Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The fallout from that Minneapolis shooting continues to rock Washington, with the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/shooting-dhs-turmoil.html) in complete turmoil and congressional leadership scrambling to prevent a government shutdown. The crisis has deepened with news that ICE [violated nearly 100](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/29/us/minnesota-ice-shooting-minneapolis) court orders, adding legal chaos to the political firestorm.

What's fascinating is how this domestic crisis is intersecting with international tensions. As Trump threatens Iran with a ["massive armada"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html) and Tehran warns of quick retaliation, America's allies are quietly hedging their bets. Starmer's in Beijing cutting deals with Xi Jinping, including visa-free travel for UK citizens to China. It's a clear signal that America's partners aren't waiting around to see how this all plays out.

The political stakes couldn't be higher. Trump and [Schumer are talking](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/trump-schumer-deal-shutdown.html) about a potential deal to avoid a shutdown, but Democrats want Homeland Security funding yanked unless there are major reforms. It's a high-stakes game of chicken that could paralyze the government just as international crises are heating up.

**Business/Tech**

• Meta's betting the farm on AI with plans to spend [at least $115 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/meta-earnings-ai-spending.html) this year. That's a staggering number that shows how seriously Zuckerberg's taking the AI arms race, even as investors are getting antsy about when all this spending will actually pay off.

• Tesla's not being outdone, announcing a [$20 billion](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOS2phRzllUWhwMzBjMXg1UkJlN1VFWXljbG5LTlJSQkdCNFJONEx1bG9NUXF6S09yaXlXUkhKeVdGVHE3N0o1eUwwNjEtYmctcjJ2RUNRUC1TMWxpX1FzYjhyVklubFRoT1NwQTVQYVdfVC1QN3B3RHE2c0ptZlRMQmIzSEpELWFkSWExRUJ6blkxS05VQWxESmVJSTg0aGtIUlJpNUh2UDJ3NnEwbkFZbHlCMlR2OVNtRFcwZ0ZrR01HUHVId3owWWV4MmdzUmxtcXhmRFRmRXE?oc=5) capital spending spree as Musk pushes hard into autonomous driving and robotics, per Reuters.

• Amazon's cutting [16,000 jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html) in another massive layoff round, while simultaneously drawing heat for promoting Melania Trump's documentary. The timing's raising questions about whether Amazon's trying to curry favor with the White House.

• Russia's Lukoil is reportedly in talks to [sell assets](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/russia-lukoil-carlyle-sale-sanctions.html) to U.S. investment firm Carlyle Group. It's a complex sanctions dance that shows how money finds a way even when geopolitics get messy.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: A plane carrying Colombian politicians [crashed in an area](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/americas/colombian-plane-politicians-missing.html) contested by rebel groups. It's a stark reminder of how fragile security remains in parts of Colombia, even years after the FARC peace deal.

• **Europe**: Greenlanders are watching America's domestic chaos and basically saying ["no thanks"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/europe/greenland-trump-anxiety-american-turmoil.html) to Trump's acquisition dreams. The irony couldn't be thicker as Trump talks about territorial expansion while his own government teeters on the edge.

• **Asia**: China's continuing to navigate its economic contradictions, with [new reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/china-economy-duality.html) from the world's busiest port showing just how unbalanced the economy really is. Export containers are flowing out while import areas sit relatively empty.

• **Middle East**: Netanyahu's making a bold declaration that Israel will [cut reliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/middleeast/israel-us-aid-weapons-gaza-biden-netanyahu.html) on U.S. military aid, citing Biden-era delays. It's classic Netanyahu political theater, but it also reflects real tensions about weapons supplies during the Gaza campaign.

• **Africa**: South Africa's facing [fresh U.S. scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html) after conducting naval drills with Iran. It's exactly the kind of "you're with us or against us" pressure that's going to define Trump's foreign policy approach.

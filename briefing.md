Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration's approach to diplomacy is taking some unusual turns. U.S. embassies are now [raising private cash](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/business/trump-july-fourth-singapore-japan.html) for lavish July Fourth parties, following the president's own fundraising model. It's part of a broader pattern that's creating ripples internationally, especially at the Munich Security Conference where [three different American speeches](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/world/europe/three-american-speeches-at-munich-and-plenty-of-confusion.html) left allies confused about U.S. positions.

The diplomatic confusion comes as allies are already making their own moves. Canada is giving U.S. arms makers [the cold shoulder](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/world/canada/canada-military-spending.html) on military spending, choosing to invest domestically instead. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers at Munich are acknowledging that Trump's [Greenland threats](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/us/politics/munich-democrats-cortez-greenland-trump.html) have left lasting diplomatic scars that won't easily heal.

• A.I. workers are making so much money that they're getting prenups to protect their [new wealth](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/business/artificial-intelligence-relationships-income-gap.html).

• The Trump administration killed [tax credits](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/business/energy-environment/epa-tax-credits-stop-start-ignition-cars.html) for start-stop engine features in vehicles, part of the broader rollback of environmental incentives.

• Bloomberg reports that Chinese stocks Laopu Gold and CMOC are [rallying sharply](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-16/laopu-gold-cmoc-shares-jump-on-addition-to-hang-seng-index) after being added to Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Brazil made Olympic history by claiming its [first-ever gold](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/world/olympics/brazil-kazakhstan-gold-medals-winter-olympics.html) at a Winter Olympics, alongside Kazakhstan's surprise victory. The wins represent major breakthroughs for countries not traditionally associated with winter sports.

• **Europe**: EU Vice President Kaja Kallas pushed back hard against Trump administration claims that Europe faces "civilizational erasure," telling officials that [Europe today](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/world/europe/europe-rubio-munich.html) looks very different from what Washington describes.

• **Asia**: Japan's economy is taking a hit from its [diplomatic feud](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/business/japan-economy-china-tourism.html) with China, particularly in tourism and trade sectors where Chinese participation has dropped significantly.

• **Middle East**: An Iranian protester's death in custody has sparked outrage, with his family believing he was [effectively executed](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/world/middleeast/ali-rahbar-iran-protester.html). The case has galvanized opposition groups demanding accountability from Tehran. Al Jazeera reports that Israel approved plans to [register West Bank lands](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/15/israel-approves-proposal-to-register-west-bank-lands-as-state-property) as state property, which Palestinians are calling de facto annexation.

• **Africa**: The Trump administration secretly deported nine migrants to Cameroon while [ignoring legal protections](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/world/africa/us-secret-deportation-cameroon.html) that should have prevented their removal, raising questions about due process in immigration enforcement.

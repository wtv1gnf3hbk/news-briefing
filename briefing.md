Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The world's getting a front-row seat to Trump 2.0 in action, and it's making everyone pretty nervous. The president's [doubling down](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news) on his Greenland threats — he says he'll "100%" impose tariffs on Denmark if they don't play ball — and European leaders are pushing back hard. It's not just diplomatic theater: markets are spooked, with [U.S. stocks tumbling](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news#stocks-trump-greenland-tariffs) on fears of a transatlantic trade war.

The timing couldn't be more dramatic, with world leaders gathering at Davos where [Trump's presence](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/europe/davos-trump-europe.html) is casting a shadow over everything. Canada's prime minister captured the mood, declaring there's been a "rupture" in the world order. Meanwhile, the EU's foreign policy chief is warning they'll "hold their ground" — diplomatic speak for "bring it on." What we're watching is Trump testing just how far he can push America's allies, and the early returns suggest we're in for a bumpy ride.

• [Stripe's co-founder says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/stripe-s-collison-says-no-rush-for-payment-firm-to-go-public) there's no "rush" for the payment giant to go public, which probably disappoints investors who've been waiting for that IPO payday.

• [An A.I. startup](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html) is making the familiar pitch that it wants to empower workers, not replace them — though we've heard that song before.

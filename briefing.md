Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The White House is scrambling to distance itself from Trump's initial response to the fatal shooting of a nurse by immigration officers in Minneapolis, as the incident becomes a defining moment for the administration's enforcement approach. The [shooting has sparked](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/26/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice) widespread protests and unrest, while Democrats are seizing on what they wanted to avoid. They're now embracing a potential government shutdown fight over ICE funding, turning the Minneapolis crisis into their line in the sand.

Meanwhile, a massive winter storm is battering the country, disrupting [thousands of flights](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/storm-flight-cancellations-delays.html) and leaving communities across multiple states dealing with dangerous conditions. The storm has already claimed at least a dozen lives and is testing infrastructure from coast to coast. It's also providing an unfortunate backdrop to the Minneapolis crisis, as emergency resources are stretched thin nationwide.

**Business/Tech**

• Silicon Valley executives are finding themselves in an awkward spot, trying to maintain their courtship of Trump while their own employees [seethe over](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/technology/ice-minnesota-protests-tech.html) the Minneapolis shootings. The tech industry's cozy relationship with the administration is getting a stress test.

• Bridgewater's co-CIOs are warning that the AI spending frenzy could fundamentally reshape the entire economy, according to Reuters. They're seeing investment patterns that go way beyond typical tech cycles.

• The [EU is investigating](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/european-union-x-grok-ai-images-musk.html) Elon Musk's X over sexualized AI images generated by its Grok chatbot. It's another regulatory headache for Musk's social media platform.

• The Washington Post has quietly [scrapped plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/business/media/washington-post-winter-olympics.html) to cover the upcoming Winter Olympics, a sign of how much the media industry is cutting back on expensive international coverage.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Venezuela's government is allowing more [economic freedom](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-economy-rodriguez.html) while keeping everything else locked down tight. It's a fascinating experiment in selective liberalization under authoritarian rule.

• **Europe**: NATO's chief delivered a blunt wake-up call, saying Europe is [absolutely dreaming](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/europe/nato-chief-europe-greenland-trump-us.html) if it thinks it can defend itself without U.S. help. The comments come as Trump's Greenland talk has everyone on edge about American commitments.

• **Asia**: Japanese panda fans are saying goodbye to their [furry ambassadors](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/japan-pandas-china.html) as China recalls the beloved animals. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping showed that even top generals aren't safe from his purges, with news that [another military leader](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/china-xi-zhang-youxia-military.html) has fallen from grace.

• **Middle East**: Intelligence briefings are telling Trump that [Iran's government](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/trump-reports-iran-government.html) is weaker than it appears, even as U.S. warships move closer to the Gulf and Tehran ramps up retaliation threats. Israel says it's recovered the [remains of](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/gaza-hostage-returned-israel.html) the last Gaza hostage, closing a painful chapter.

• **Africa**: A South African court has ruled that [Nelson Mandela memorabilia](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html) can go to auction, ending a legal battle over the anti-apartheid leader's personal items. The decision has stirred debate about preserving historical artifacts versus family rights.

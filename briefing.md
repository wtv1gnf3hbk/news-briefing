Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's immigration crackdown is hitting a crossroads in Minnesota, where [Border Czar Tom Homan](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/tom-homan-minnesota-ice.html) is trying to calm tensions after a federal judge denied requests to block the ICE surge there. The situation's gotten complicated fast. [Federal courts are pushing back](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/habeas-corpus-detainee-immigrant-trump-federal-courts.html) on the broader deportation campaign through habeas corpus rulings, while the death of Alex Pretti has become [a national flashpoint](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/alex-pretti-minneapolis.html) in the immigration debate.

The international picture reflects similar tensions over movement and borders. The [Rafah crossing](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/1/live-israel-to-partially-open-rafah-in-gaza-as-dozens-killed-in-attacks) opened on a trial basis today, though it's unclear what restrictions will govern Palestinians trying to return to Gaza. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Epstein's financial records continue generating headlines, with the BBC reporting he sent [$75,000 to accounts](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn82elvzpz7o) linked to Lord Mandelson, who says he has no record of receiving the money.

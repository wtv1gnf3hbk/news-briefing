Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump family's crypto venture just got a lot more complicated. A [U.A.E. firm](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html) quietly took a stake in World Liberty Financial, raising fresh questions about foreign influence and the president's business entanglements. This isn't just about money — it's about the optics of Middle Eastern investment in a Trump family business while he's setting regional policy.

Meanwhile, the cultural and political worlds are colliding in ways that feel distinctly 2026. Bad Bunny used his Grammy acceptance speech to declare "[ICE out](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/01/arts/grammys-2026#bad-bunny-speech-ice-grammys)", turning music's biggest night into a platform for immigration politics. The moment captures how Trump's deportation operations are rippling through American culture, with artists increasingly willing to use their platforms for direct political confrontation.

- [OpenAI's raising](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html) as much as $100 billion in what would be one of the largest private funding rounds ever — a sign of just how much capital is chasing AI leadership right now.

- The [A.I. boom](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/ai-memory-chips-pc-smartphone.html) could make your next PC more expensive as demand for specialized memory chips drives up prices across consumer electronics.

- Wall Street's latest bet is "[Sell America](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/business/sell-america-dollar-financial-markets.html)" — traders are increasingly skeptical about U.S. financial dominance as global dynamics shift.

**Around the World**

- **Latin America**: Costa Rica's heading for a [right-wing populist](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/americas/costa-rica-election.html) victory next week, with the leading candidate channeling the Trump playbook in a country that's been a Central American stability anchor.

- **Europe**: Russia struck Ukraine's [energy sector](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/europe/russia-strikes-ukraine-energy-sector-killing-12-miners.html) again, killing 12 miners in what looks like a deliberate effort to cripple civilian infrastructure as winter drags on.

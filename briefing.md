Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump made quite the splash at Davos yesterday, delivering a [sprawling address](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-davos-speech-takeaways.html) that touched on everything from his Greenland ambitions to energy policy. The president reassured European leaders he won't use military force to acquire Greenland, but he's clearly not dropping the idea entirely. The speech was vintage Trump — part reassurance, part provocation — and it's already creating some awkward diplomatic moments. California Governor Gavin Newsom says he was [blocked from entering](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news#newsom-davos-trump) the U.S. pavilion, a petty but telling sign of how this administration plans to handle political opponents.

Back home, Trump's immigration crackdown is accelerating with [operations in Maine](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/maine-somali-immigration-enforcement.html) targeting Somali communities. The administration is moving fast and hard, but there are already friction points emerging with local authorities and Democratic governors who are pushing back against what they see as federal overreach.

**Business/Tech**

• [Uber's facing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/uber-scrutiny-sexual-assault.html) renewed scrutiny over its sexual assault record as lawmakers and advocacy groups ramp up pressure on the ride-hailing giant to do more to protect passengers.

• [Snap settled](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/snap-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html) a major social media addiction lawsuit just before what would have been a landmark trial — a move that avoids setting legal precedent but suggests the company wanted to avoid a messy public battle.

• An AI startup called Eightfold is getting [sued for allegedly](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3wFBVV95cUxNUktLUERrX1F0NHNUNkZtRHV0dkFiZGxtSU9XcmxjQ1p5cGxMVV9oc2R4V3VnemlHMWlVS3U2M3NNN0p3WUt6Q0FDbVB3RGIxdWtvclVVQTl6TmxFLXhXbDNMaVVEQWpQc0x5Rm5UZWptMmdRamRZQjRvSktLODJaWGNEbzlOVVdiMG5idURQREduLXRaZGxURmt5RXcyUTM1M2g3S0ZyU2ZHdHc5NEJQWXhmYll6aG53cUZWMWY1U1FSckhHQXMwOGplYjBYYm9qOEZFMHQxaTcyQU5LYzhZ?oc=5) helping companies secretly score job seekers, which raises some uncomfortable questions about algorithmic bias in hiring, Reuters reports.

• The [FTC is appealing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/ftc-meta-antitrust-appeal.html) its recent loss in the Meta antitrust case, signaling the agency isn't done trying to rein in Big Tech despite courtroom setbacks.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: A majority of Latin Americans actually [endorsed Trump's raid](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html) in Venezuela, according to new polling that shows how unpopular Maduro's regime has become across the region, even among countries usually wary of U.S. intervention.

• **Europe**: The EU just [suspended approval](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwp2me3gzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss) of a U.S. trade deal, a direct response to Trump's renewed push for Greenland that shows European leaders are getting tired of his territorial ambitions, the BBC notes.

• **Asia**: Japan [restarted the world's](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/japan-nuclear-restart.html) biggest nuclear plant as the country tries to meet climate goals, though public anxiety about nuclear power remains high more than a decade after Fukushima.

• **Middle East**: Israel just [seized the Jerusalem](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-jerusalem.html) headquarters of UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, escalating its campaign against the organization it accuses of harboring Hamas sympathizers.

• **Africa**: More than 160 people were [kidnapped from](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html) a Christian church in Nigeria, according to police and church leaders, highlighting the country's ongoing security crisis in rural areas where armed groups operate with impunity.

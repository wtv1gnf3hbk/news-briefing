Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Immigration enforcement is hitting some legal speed bumps as the Trump administration ramps up deportations. An [immigration judge ruled](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/immigration-judge-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk.html) that the government cannot deport a Tufts University student, marking an early judicial pushback against the administration's expanded removal efforts. It's part of a broader pattern where [D.H.S. claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/homeland-security-shootings.html) about deportation cases are unraveling when they face courtroom scrutiny.

Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine continues its grinding trajectory. Russian forces are [closing in](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/europe/russia-ukraine-battlefield-huliaipole-pokrovsk.html) on key Ukrainian towns after months of sustained assaults, while residents in Kyiv are [finding creative ways](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/europe/ukraine-war-russia-power-cold.html) to stay warm without reliable electricity. The battlefield momentum comes as [peace negotiations](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html) remain in the background and Trump weighs his [reconstruction plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/world/europe/ukraine-reconstruction-blackrock.html) for the country.

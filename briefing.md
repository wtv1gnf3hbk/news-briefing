Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The financial world is wrestling with an uncomfortable truth: thousands of amateur traders on prediction markets are consistently [outperforming Wall Street](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/business/economy/forecasts-prediction-markets-economy.html) analysts when it comes to economic forecasting. These everyday gamblers, armed with little more than internet access and betting instincts, are beating PhD economists at their own game. It's raising serious questions about how we value expertise in an age where crowd wisdom can trump institutional knowledge.

Meanwhile, a devastating [mass shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/world/canada/canada-shooting-tumbler-ridge-british-columbia.html) in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge has left nine people dead and 25 injured, making it one of the deadliest attacks in the nation's history. Students and teachers [hid for hours](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/world/canada/tumbler-ridge-shooting-school-teacher.html) as the gunman moved between a school and related residence before reportedly taking their own life. The tight-knit community of just 2,000 people is reeling, with the mayor saying he'll likely know every victim personally.

Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The release of [Jeffrey Epstein's](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/12/us/politics/epstein-files.html) vast email archive has sent shockwaves through elite circles on both sides of the Atlantic, and this morning brought the most dramatic development yet. UK police [arrested Andrew](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/19/world/uk-prince-andrew-arrest-epstein) Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office, directly tied to his connections with the late financier. The former prince's ties to Epstein are now creating headaches for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which has been trying to distance itself from the scandal.

The timing couldn't be more fraught. While Britain grapples with this royal scandal, the U.S. is engaged in its own high-stakes diplomatic gamble with Iran. American officials are positioning [military assets](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/18/us/politics/us-military-iran.html) across the region while simultaneously pursuing nuclear talks in Geneva. Iran has responded by conducting [military exercises](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/world/middleeast/iran-strait-hormuz-exercise-talks-geneva-trump.html) in the Strait of Hormuz, creating the kind of gunboat diplomacy that could either force a breakthrough or spiral into conflict. Trump has openly discussed [regime change](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/us/politics/trump-iran-regime-change.html) options, raising the stakes considerably.

Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The crisis in Minneapolis is reshaping immigration politics across the country, as [legislators move](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html) to restrict ICE operations in their states following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti during an immigration raid. What started as a local tragedy has become a full-blown test of federal versus state authority, with Stephen Miller now suggesting federal agents may have [diverted from protocol](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html) in the shooting. The political fallout briefly put Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in [Trump's penalty box](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/noem-trump-minnesota-shooting-fallout.html), though she's apparently back in favor.

The broader stakes here go well beyond one incident. Trump's immigration crackdown was supposed to be his signature early victory, but Minneapolis has become a symbol of resistance that's energizing Democratic governors and state legislators nationwide. The administration clearly recognizes they have [a big problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-minnesota-noem-bovino-homan-miller.html) on their hands. Meanwhile, Jerome Powell and the Fed are meeting at what's being called [a pivotal moment](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/economy/fed-trump-powell-interest-rates.html) for the central bank's independence, as Trump continues pressuring for rate cuts.

**Business/Tech**

• [Amazon's cutting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html) about 16,000 corporate jobs in its latest round of layoffs, signaling the tech giant is still trying to right-size after its pandemic hiring spree.

• Microsoft's facing an awkward contradiction: it [pledged to save](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html) water, but now expects its usage to soar because of AI data centers. The environmental costs of the AI boom are getting harder to ignore.

• [Social media giants](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/social-media-addiction-trial.html) are facing landmark legal tests on child safety that could reshape how platforms operate if courts find them liable for addiction among minors.

• The [Sundance Film Festival](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/media/sundance-film-festival-park-city-boulder.html) is saying goodbye to Park City after decades, moving to Boulder in a shift that says something about changing economics in the film world.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Trinidadian families have [filed a lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html) over a boat strike by the U.S. military, highlighting tensions as Washington ramps up Caribbean operations under Trump's immigration crackdown.

• **Europe**: A Russian strike killed five people, but Ukraine's railway kept running after [train cars burned](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html). It's a small but telling symbol of Ukrainian resilience as the war grinds on into its third year.

• **Asia**: There's a [missing American citizen](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html) in Kabul that witnesses say was held by the Taliban. It's another reminder of how precarious things remain for Americans in Afghanistan.

• **Middle East**: Trump's been [briefed on intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/trump-reports-iran-government.html) suggesting Iran's government is weaker than it appears, which could explain his increasingly aggressive posture toward Tehran. The BBC notes he's warning that ["time is running out"](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5pd459gko) for a nuclear deal.

• **Africa**: South Africa is facing [new U.S. scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html) after conducting naval drills with Iran. It's exactly the kind of partnership that's going to draw Trump's ire as he takes a harder line globally.

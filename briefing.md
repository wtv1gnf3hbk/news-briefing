Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The civil rights movement has lost one of its most powerful voices. [Jesse Jackson](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/us/jesse-jackson-dead.html), the charismatic preacher and activist who transformed American politics through two groundbreaking presidential campaigns and decades of advocacy, died at 84. From his early days marching with Martin Luther King Jr. to building a rainbow coalition that redefined what was possible in electoral politics, Jackson helped shape the modern Democratic Party and paved the way for Barack Obama's presidency.

The timing feels particularly poignant as [nuclear negotiations](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/us/politics/us-iran-nuclear-talks.html) between the U.S. and Iran resume today in Switzerland, with tensions already running high. Al Jazeera reports that Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei criticized Trump ahead of the talks, while Iranian forces conducted [military exercises](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/world/middleeast/iran-strait-hormuz-exercise-talks-geneva-trump.html) in the Strait of Hormuz. The second round of talks comes as protesters' memorials in Iran are testing the [state's crackdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/world/middleeast/iran-memorials-protesters-crackdown.html) on dissent.

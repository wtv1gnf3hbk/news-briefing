Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump is [escalating his tariff](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html) strategy after the Supreme Court struck down parts of his original trade policy, now announcing a 15 percent global tariff on all imports. This move comes as the Court's conservative justices showed unexpected [divisions over Trump's agenda](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html), with Justice Gorsuch delivering what many see as a subtle rebuke to an overreaching executive branch. The ruling has left global businesses navigating what one analyst called ["murky waters"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/tariffs-supreme-court-global-busines-reaction.html) as they try to figure out what comes next.

The broader trade war is creating ripple effects everywhere from India's oil purchases to European inflation rates. Meanwhile, consumers are stuck in a [waiting game](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/tariff-ruling-consumer-prices.html) trying to figure out when and how much prices might rise. Trump also moved to close the ["de minimis" loophole](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-deminimis-loophole-closed.html) that allowed cheap imports under $800 to enter duty-free, targeting the flood of packages from Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein.

**Business/Tech**

- Honeywell is thinking about [walking away](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/honeywell-considers-walking-away-from-johnson-matthey-catalyst-deal) from its acquisition of Johnson Matthey's catalyst business, according to Bloomberg, as deal-making gets trickier in this environment.

- There's growing skepticism about the AI boom compared to the dot-com era, with people expressing [less enthusiasm](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html) for artificial intelligence despite all the corporate investment.

- The credit markets are flashing warning signs as the [riskiest CLO funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/riskiest-clo-funds-are-flashing-a-warning-sign-credit-weekly) show stress from fears about rising defaults in leveraged loans.

- AI isn't coming for [every white-collar job](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/technology/ai-coding-software-jobs.html) quite yet, despite the hype around automation replacing knowledge workers.

**Around the World**

- **Latin America**: Colombia's military is getting outmaneuvered by [$600 commercial drones](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/americas/colombia-combat-drones-military.html) that armed groups are using to devastating effect against billion-dollar defense systems.

- **Europe**: King Charles is [pulling away](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/europe/andrew-epstein-queen-elizabeth-charles.html) from Prince Andrew over his Jeffrey Epstein connections, marking a clear break from Queen Elizabeth's approach of standing by her scandal-plagued son.

- **Asia**: India's oil importing just got more complicated as New Delhi tries to navigate [buying Russian crude](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/india-russia-oil-trump-tariffs.html) under Trump's new tariff regime while managing its relationship with Washington.

- **Middle East**: Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon killed [at least 10 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah.html), according to officials, in what Israel said was an operation targeting Hezbollah members.

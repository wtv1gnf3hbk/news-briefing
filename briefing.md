Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's immigration enforcement is hitting some serious turbulence in Minnesota, where [border czar](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/tom-homan-minnesota-ice.html) Tom Homan is trying to calm tensions after ICE operations sparked widespread protests. The situation's gotten complicated enough that a [5-year-old and father](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/01/us/trump-news) were just released from detention, while federal courts are increasingly [pushing back](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/habeas-corpus-detainee-immigrant-trump-federal-courts.html) against the administration's mass deportation plans through habeas corpus rulings.

The broader immigration crackdown is creating ripple effects across Trump's agenda. He's even [reached out](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/us/politics/trump-schumer-deal.html) to Chuck Schumer about cutting some kind of deal, according to Bloomberg, suggesting the political backlash might be stronger than expected. Meanwhile, questions about Trump's financial entanglements keep surfacing - there's news that a [UAE firm](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html) quietly bought into his family's crypto company, and he's now [suing the IRS](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/politics/trump-lawsuit-irs-taxes.html) over his taxes.

**Business/Tech**

• [OpenAI's hunting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html) for another massive funding round that could reach $100 billion, which would be wild even by Silicon Valley standards.

• The "Sell America" trade is becoming the hot new thing on [Wall Street](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/business/sell-america-dollar-financial-markets.html), with traders betting against the dollar and U.S. assets as Trump's policies create uncertainty.

• [Target's new CEO](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/business/target-ceo-minneapolis.html) is dealing with a perfect storm - trying to turn around the company while his Minneapolis headquarters is at the center of the immigration enforcement crisis.

• The AI boom might make your [next PC](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/ai-memory-chips-pc-smartphone.html) way more expensive because of skyrocketing demand for memory chips.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Costa Rica's heading into an election with a [right-wing populist](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/americas/costa-rica-election.html) holding a commanding lead, which would be a big shift for this traditionally centrist country.

• **Europe**: Russia killed [12 miners](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/europe/russia-strikes-ukraine-energy-sector-killing-12-miners.html) in a strike on Ukraine's energy sector, while peace talks got delayed after the U.S. and Russia met directly, according to Reuters.

• **Asia**: Indonesia just [lifted its ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html) on Grok after getting new assurances from X Corp, and Myanmar's government-in-exile is [teetering on irrelevance](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/myanmar-coup-anniversary-government.html) years after the coup.

• **Middle East**: The [Rafah crossing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/middleeast/rafah-crossing-gaza-egypt-israel.html) is set to reopen partially, but thousands are still waiting for medical evacuation from Gaza. Iran's dealing with [mysterious explosions](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/world/middleeast/iran-explosions-jitters.html) that have everyone on edge about possible foreign attacks.

• **Africa**: Egypt's been running a [secret air base](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html) that's fueling Sudan's devastating drone war, while devastating floods have [displaced hundreds of thousands](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/africa/mozambique-south-africa-flood.html) across southern Africa.

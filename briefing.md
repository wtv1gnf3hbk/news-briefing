Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's [Davos appearance](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-davos-speech-takeaways.html) yesterday created the kind of global stir we've come to expect, but with a twist that matters for international relations. He floated what he called a "[Greenland framework](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news)" for some kind of future deal, stepping back from his earlier tariff threats against Europe. NATO allies are now quietly discussing U.S. sovereignty over bases there, which represents a significant shift in how they're responding to Trump's territorial ambitions.

The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump's attempt to [fire Fed](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-fed-cook.html) Governor Michelle Cook, with justices seeming skeptical of executive power over central bank independence. It's an early test of how far Trump can push institutional boundaries, and the court's eventual ruling could define the Fed's autonomy for decades. Meanwhile, ICE operations are ramping up nationwide, creating the kind of federal-local tensions that defined Trump's first term.

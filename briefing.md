Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Epstein scandal is rippling through British politics as [U.K. police](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/peter-mandelson-uk-epstein.html) investigate Peter Mandelson, the former ambassador to Washington, over claims he leaked information to Jeffrey Epstein. This comes as the Met also reviews fresh allegations about Prince Andrew's connections to the disgraced financier. The timing couldn't be worse for Mandelson, who's expected to take up his post as Britain's next ambassador to the U.S. The investigations underscore how the Epstein affair continues to cast a shadow over high-profile figures on both sides of the Atlantic.

Meanwhile, tensions are escalating between Washington and Tehran after the U.S. [shot down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/us-iran-drone-downing.html) an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea near an American aircraft carrier. The Pentagon says the drone was approaching the vessel when it was intercepted, marking another flashpoint in the already strained relationship. Oil markets are responding to the geopolitical jitters, with prices climbing for the second straight day.

**Business/Tech**

- [Walmart hit](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/walmart-trillion-market-value.html) the $1 trillion market cap milestone, joining the exclusive club of mega-cap companies that's been dominated by tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. It's a remarkable transformation for the Arkansas retailer.

- [Disney named](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/disney-damaro-ceo.html) Josh D'Amaro as its next CEO, tapping the parks chief to lead the entertainment empire through its next chapter. D'Amaro's been credited with revitalizing Disney's theme park operations post-pandemic.

- [Elon Musk merged](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html) SpaceX with his AI startup xAI in a deal that further consolidates his business empire. The move signals Musk's bet that space and artificial intelligence will increasingly intersect.

- [Waymo raised](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/waymo-funding-growth.html) $16 billion in fresh funding to fuel its global expansion plans, a massive war chest that underscores investor confidence in autonomous driving technology.

**Around the World**

- **Latin America**: [Venezuela's authoritarian grip](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/americas/venezuela-rodriguez-maduro-authoritarian.html) appears to be loosening slightly, but analysts warn it's too early to tell whether the shift represents genuine political opening or tactical maneuvering by the Maduro regime.

- **Europe**: British authorities are [investigating Peter Mandelson](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/peter-mandelson-uk-epstein.html) over allegations he shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein, a bombshell that threatens his expected appointment as ambassador to Washington.

- **Asia**: [At least 30 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/asia/japan-snow-deaths.html) have died in Japan after weeks of unprecedented snowfall battered the country, with authorities warning conditions remain dangerous across several prefectures.

- **Middle East**: [Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/middleeast/libya-seif-al-islam-el-qaddafi-killed.html) was killed in an attack in Libya, according to his lawyer. The death of Muammar el-Qaddafi's son removes a key figure who once seemed destined to inherit power in the North African nation.

- **Africa**: Health officials warn that ['biblical diseases'](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/health/neglected-tropical-diseases-usaid-ntds-river-blindness.html) like river blindness and sleeping sickness could make a comeback across Africa as international funding for prevention programs faces cuts under the new U.S. administration.

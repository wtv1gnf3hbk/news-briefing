Iran's back to business at its nuclear and missile facilities, according to new [satellite imagery](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/world/middleeast/iran-missile-nuclear-repairs.html) that shows Tehran rebuilding sites damaged in recent Israeli strikes. This comes as [indirect talks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/6/us-iran-talks-live-critical-negotiations-set-to-begin-in-oman) between the U.S. and Iran in Oman have ended "for now," Al Jazeera reports.

Elsewhere, the world's trying to focus on the [Winter Olympics](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/world/europe/olympics-world-order-war.html) opening ceremonies in Milan today, though the games are playing out against a backdrop of global tensions that make the Olympic ideal of harmony feel pretty distant. Even Pope Leo felt compelled to warn against using sports for "propaganda or national supremacy" as the ceremonies kick off.

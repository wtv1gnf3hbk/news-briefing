Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration's immigration crackdown has taken a deadly turn in Minneapolis, where [ICE agents shot](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/alex-jeffrey-pretti-was-an-icu-nurse-at-the-va-hospital.html) and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen and ICU nurse at a VA hospital. It's the [second fatal shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/politics/second-ice-shooting-minneapolis.html) by federal agents in the city this week, and the details are sparking fierce debate about enforcement tactics. Gun rights activists are pushing back against suggestions that Pretti's possession of a pistol justified the killing, while [Democrats in Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/democrats-congress-reaction.html) are threatening to block ICE funding entirely.

Meanwhile, a massive winter storm is paralyzing much of the country, with [over 14,500 flights grounded](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/24/weather/winter-storm-snow-ice) and power grid emergencies declared across multiple states. Bloomberg reports the storm could dump a foot of snow on New York City alone. The timing couldn't be worse for the administration, which is already dealing with political fallout from the Minneapolis shootings.

**Business/Tech**

• The [Washington Post scrapped](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/business/media/washington-post-winter-olympics.html) its plans to cover the Winter Olympics entirely, another sign of the media industry's continued belt-tightening as traditional revenue models collapse.

• [TikTok's ownership saga](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance-china-us.html) finally wrapped up with a complex deal creating a new U.S. entity, though the exact ownership structure between Oracle, ByteDance, and other investors remains murky.

• An [AI coding tool](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/technology/claude-code.html) called Claude is going viral as users discover creative applications beyond just writing software, from automating spreadsheets to generating creative content.

• [New 401(k) rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/your-money/401k-contributions-catch-up-roth-retirement.html) for 2026 are changing how "catch-up" contributions work for older Americans, with some now required to go into Roth accounts rather than traditional pre-tax savings.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Colombia lost one of its most important chroniclers when [Beatriz González died](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/arts/design/beatriz-gonzalez-dead.html) at 93. The artist spent decades documenting her country's violence and turmoil through haunting paintings that became symbols of resilience.

• **Europe**: [Ukraine peace talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/europe/ukraine-us-russia-peace-talks.html) wrapped up with no breakthrough but what Zelensky called a "constructive" tone. The trilateral discussions with the U.S. may resume next month as fighting continues on the ground.

• **Asia**: Xi Jinping's military purge claimed another high-profile victim as China announced it's [investigating its top general](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/asia/china-top-general-xi-military-purge.html) for unspecified "serious violations." The probe continues Xi's systematic cleanup of the People's Liberation Army leadership.

• **Middle East**: Syria's new government [extended its ceasefire](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/middleeast/syria-kurdish-militia.html) with Kurdish militias just hours after the original truce expired, buying more time for negotiations in the country's fragile transition.

• **Africa**: A South African court ruled that [Nelson Mandela memorabilia](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html) can proceed to auction despite family objections, ending a legal battle over items that include personal letters and photographs from the anti-apartheid leader's estate.

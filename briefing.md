Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Canada is reeling from a deadly school shooting that shattered the quiet of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia. [Nine people](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/canada/canada-shooting-tumbler-ridge.html) were killed at a high school and related residence, with at least 25 others injured, before the shooter apparently took their own life. The attack has jolted this peaceful mountain town and reignited conversations about gun violence just six years after Canada implemented [major reforms](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/10/world/tumbler-ridge-school-shooting/canada-gun-reforms-shooting) following its deadliest mass shooting in 2020.

The shooting is dominating international coverage today, with outlets from the BBC to The Economist leading with the story. It's a stark reminder that even countries with stricter gun laws aren't immune to such tragedies, and it comes as other democracies grapple with their own challenges around political polarization and social tensions.

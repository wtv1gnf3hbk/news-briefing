Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Minneapolis shooting crisis is reshaping American politics in real time. What started as an immigration enforcement operation has become a [national flashpoint](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-reaction.html) that's forcing uncomfortable questions about federal power and conservative identity. Trump's [leadership shakeup](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/27/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota) of his immigration crackdown suggests even his administration recognizes this isn't playing out as planned.

The economic backdrop isn't helping anyone's mood. [Record debt levels](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/business/economy/government-debt-bonds.html) across wealthy nations are starting to worry markets about global growth prospects, while the [Fed signals](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/business/economy/fed-rate-decision-outlook.html) it's in no rush to cut rates further. Meanwhile, Trump's heading to Iowa to tout economic wins, but [many residents](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trump-iowa-farms-tariffs.html) are feeling the squeeze from his trade policies.

**Business/Tech**

• The AI hype machine might be hitting a wall. A prominent [tech pioneer warns](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/technology/an-ai-pioneer-warns-the-tech-herd-is-marching-into-a-dead-end.html) that Silicon Valley's current approach is heading toward a dead end, even as everyone doubles down on the technology.

• [Tesla's stock targets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/tesla-s-price-target-is-rising-even-as-its-profit-outlook-tanks) keep rising on Wall Street despite analysts growing more pessimistic about the company's actual earnings potential this year. Classic disconnect between hype and fundamentals, according to Bloomberg.

• [Germany sold](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/germany-tests-demand-for-new-20-year-bond-in-sale-via-banks) €6.5 billion in new 20-year bonds with near-record demand, suggesting investors are still hunting for safe havens despite all the debt concerns.

• The EU is investigating [Musk's X platform](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/european-union-x-grok-ai-images-musk.html) over its AI tool creating sexualized images, adding another regulatory headache for the social media company.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Venezuela's government is [liberalizing its economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-economy-rodriguez.html) while keeping everything else locked down tight. It's a fascinating experiment in selective authoritarianism that's actually showing some economic results.

• **Europe**: Britain's trying to thread an impossible needle, [seeking closer trade](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/europe/uk-china-visit-starmer-trade.html) ties with China without triggering Trump's wrath. The balancing act reflects how much the geopolitical landscape has shifted in just a week.

• **Asia**: Trump's [threatening higher tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/asia/korea-trump-higher-tariff.html) on South Korea just months after they struck a trade deal, leaving Seoul scrambling to figure out what happened to their carefully negotiated agreement.

• **Middle East**: [U.S. warships](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/us-warships-gulf-waters-iran-retaliation-threats.html) are moving closer to Iranian waters as Tehran and its allies ramp up retaliation threats. The tension is building after intelligence briefings suggested Iran's government is weaker than it appears.

• **Africa**: A South African court ruled that [Nelson Mandela memorabilia](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html) can proceed to auction, ending a family dispute over who controls the former president's legacy items.

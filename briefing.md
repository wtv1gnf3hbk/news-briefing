Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Supreme Court delivered a stunning rebuke to Trump yesterday, [striking down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-roberts-tariffs.html) his sweeping global tariffs in a decision that cuts to the heart of his economic agenda. The 6-3 ruling found that Trump's broad import taxes exceeded presidential authority, with Chief Justice Roberts writing for the majority. Trump's response was swift and furious, calling the justices who ruled against him ["fools and lap dogs"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/us/politics/trump-justices-gorsuch-barrett-roberts.html) and immediately imposing [new 10% duties](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/20/us/trump-tariffs-supreme-court) on a range of goods.

The showdown represents a rare institutional check on presidential power, but it's hardly slowing Trump down. He's also [weighing military action](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/20/us/trump-news) against Iran, acknowledging he's considering a "limited strike" after giving Tehran roughly 10 days to agree to nuclear restrictions. The dual crises are testing how far Trump can push both the courts and Congress as he tries to reshape American foreign and economic policy through executive action.

**Business/Tech**

- The [U.S. economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/us-economy-gdp.html) grew just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.4% pace that's adding pressure on Trump's growth promises.

- Stock markets are sending [mixed signals](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/stocks-markets-mixed-signals.html) despite recent highs, with investors uncertain how to price in the Supreme Court's tariff ruling and Trump's unpredictable policy moves.

**Around the World**

- **Latin America**: Trump has imposed what amounts to [a new blockade](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/americas/cuba-oil-blockade-trump.html) on Cuba, targeting the island's oil supply lines in a move that's strangling the already fragile economy.

Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The world's economic and political elite are getting a front-row seat to Trump's second-term diplomacy at Davos, and it's quite the show. [Trump's appearing](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news) via video link from the White House, where he's doubling down on his threats to acquire Greenland while insisting he won't use military force. The spectacle reached peak awkwardness when California Governor Gavin Newsom was [reportedly blocked](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news#newsom-davos-trump) from entering the U.S. pavilion at the forum.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called defending Greenland Europe's "[No. 1 priority](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/greenland-ukraine-nato-rutte.html)" as the alliance grapples with Trump's territorial ambitions. The president also found time to [rebuke Canada's](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-mark-carney-davos-speech.html) new finance minister at Davos, showing his willingness to publicly dress down allies. Meanwhile, the EU is struggling with its own economic challenges as a [major trade deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/mercosur-trade-deal-eu.html) with South America hits fresh obstacles just when Europe needs to diversify away from China and the U.S.

**Business/Tech**

• [Uber's facing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/uber-scrutiny-sexual-assault.html) mounting pressure over its sexual assault record as regulators and advocacy groups demand better safety measures from the ride-hailing giant.

• An AI startup is making the bold claim that it [wants to](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html) empower workers rather than replace them, swimming against the current narrative about automation's impact on jobs.

• [Snap settled](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/snap-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html) a social media addiction lawsuit just ahead of what could have been a landmark trial about tech platforms' responsibility for user wellbeing.

• The FTC is [appealing its loss](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/ftc-meta-antitrust-appeal.html) in the Meta antitrust case, keeping the fight over Big Tech's market power alive in the courts.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Most Latin Americans actually [support Trump's raid](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html) in Venezuela, according to new polling that shows regional frustration with the Maduro regime outweighs concerns about U.S. intervention.

• **Europe**: Prince Harry gave [emotional testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/prince-harry-emotional-court-daily-mail.html) in his case against the Daily Mail, describing how news coverage affected his mental health and relationships.

• **Asia**: Japan has [restarted the](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/japan-nuclear-restart.html) world's biggest nuclear plant as the country weighs energy security against lingering public anxiety about atomic power after Fukushima.

• **Middle East**: The U.S. has [started moving](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/middleeast/isis-syria-prisons-iraq.html) ISIS detainees from Syrian prisons to Iraq, part of the complex logistics of managing jihadist prisoners as Syria's new government takes shape.

• **Africa**: Church leaders and police say [over 160 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html) were kidnapped from a church in Nigeria, highlighting the country's ongoing security crisis that has drawn Trump's military attention.

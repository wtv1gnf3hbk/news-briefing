Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The big story this morning is Trump's dramatic escalation in his push to reshape American elections. The president is now [calling for Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-nationalize-elections.html) to "nationalize" elections, marking his most aggressive move yet to centralize control over voting systems. This comes as he's simultaneously pressuring House holdouts on a [spending deal](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/02/us/trump-news) that's gaining momentum but still faces resistance from fiscal conservatives.

The Epstein files continue to reverberate on both sides of the Atlantic. The [Clintons have agreed](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/bill-hillary-clinton-epstein-comer-contempt.html) to testify in the House Epstein inquiry after initially resisting, while across the pond, the BBC reports that British authorities are reviewing misconduct claims after files suggest Peter Mandelson sent government information to Epstein. It's a reminder of how these revelations are creating political headaches far beyond U.S. borders.

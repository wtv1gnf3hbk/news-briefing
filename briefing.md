Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Supreme Court has been quietly expanding its secrecy operations in ways that would make even the CIA proud. Our investigation reveals the Court has been [requiring unprecedented](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/supreme-court-nondisclosure-agreements.html) nondisclosure agreements from staff and contractors, essentially building a wall of silence around an institution that's already the most opaque branch of government. This matters because it comes as the Court faces mounting scrutiny over ethics violations and its role in reshaping American law with minimal public accountability.

Meanwhile, there's a small but significant breakthrough in Gaza. The [Rafah crossing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/middleeast/gaza-rafah-border-crossing.html) between Gaza and Egypt has reopened for the first time in months, allowing critically ill Palestinians to finally get medical treatment abroad. It's one of the clearest signs yet that the fragile cease-fire is holding, even as tragic reminders persist. Al Jazeera reports a child was killed by Israeli fire as families prepared to leave through the crossing.

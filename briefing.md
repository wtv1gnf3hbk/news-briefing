Good morning. Here's the state of play:

A [former police chief](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/trump-epstein.html) has revealed that Trump told him back in 2006 that "everyone" knew about Jeffrey Epstein's predatory behavior. The revelation comes as part of a massive document dump that's sending shockwaves through Washington, Hollywood and beyond. The newly released Epstein files show the disgraced financier's web extended far deeper than previously known, revealing [efforts to cultivate ties](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/business/epstein-files-russia-putin.html) with Russian officials and his influence operations at Columbia and NYU.

The fallout is already hitting Trump's inner circle. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has [acknowledged visiting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/howard-lutnick-jeffrey-epstein-island.html) Epstein's island, while pop star Chappell Roan has [left her talent agency](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/arts/music/chappell-roan-casey-wasserman-epstein-agency.html) after its founder's name surfaced in the documents. The files also reveal that Epstein [directed an aide](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/epstein-hidden-cameras.html) to obtain hidden video cameras, suggesting a surveillance operation that may have been used for blackmail.

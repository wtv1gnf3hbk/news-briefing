Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Minneapolis situation is reshaping immigration politics in ways that go far beyond Minnesota. [State legislators](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html) across the country are moving to restrict ICE operations in their jurisdictions after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, which has become a flashpoint for Trump's immigration enforcement. The federal response is fracturing along predictable lines, but what's notable is how some [Republicans are breaking](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/republicans-shift-tone-immigration.html) with Trump's approach. That's significant because it suggests the political calculus around immigration enforcement may be shifting faster than anyone expected.

The immediate crisis escalated further yesterday when someone [attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota) at a town hall, spraying an unknown substance on her. She continued speaking, but it underscores how volatile things have become. The BBC notes Omar was defiant afterward, saying ["I don't let bullies win."](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9zpee3llxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss) Meanwhile, DHS documents contradict [Homeland Security Secretary Noem's claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/pretti-shooting-minneapolis-dhs-report.html) about what happened during the shooting, adding another layer of controversy to an already messy situation.

**Business/Tech**

• Traders are betting [Rick Rieder](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-28/traders-bet-on-more-rate-cuts-if-rick-rieder-leads-the-fed) could bring more aggressive rate cuts if he lands the Fed chair job. Bloomberg reports the BlackRock executive is the leading candidate, and markets are already pricing in what that might mean for monetary policy.

• The [euro's rally](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/euro-rally-to-1-20-spurs-more-buying-and-a-headache-for-the-ecb) to $1.20 is creating headaches for the European Central Bank, according to Bloomberg. It's the strongest level since 2021, and it's complicating the ECB's efforts to manage eurozone growth.

• Meta is running [advertising campaigns](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/meta-data-center-ads.html) to change public opinion about data centers as the company faces growing resistance to its infrastructure expansion plans.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Families in Trinidad and Tobago have filed a [wrongful death lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html) against the U.S. military over a boat strike incident. It's a rare case of Caribbean nations taking legal action against American military operations in their waters.

• **Europe**: Life in [Kherson has become](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/kherson-ukraine-drones-russia.html) a daily gamble with death as Russian drones hunt civilians on the streets. Every step outside risks becoming a target in what's essentially become urban drone warfare. The BBC reports that overnight, Russian drones [killed five people](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkrpl4ngdzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss) on a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine.

• **Asia**: A veteran [Indian politician died](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/india-plane-crash.html) along with four others in a plane crash that's being investigated by aviation authorities. The politician was a key figure in regional politics and had been traveling for official business.

• **Middle East**: New reporting reveals the [stories of five](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/middleeast/iran-protester-deaths.html) of the thousands of protesters killed by Iranian authorities during recent unrest. It's part of mounting evidence about the scale of the government's crackdown on dissent.

• **Africa**: [South Africa's naval drills](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html) with Iran are drawing fresh scrutiny from Washington under the new administration. The exercises have become a test case for how Trump plans to handle countries that maintain military ties with Tehran.

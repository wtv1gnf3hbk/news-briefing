Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The big picture today is all about alliances under pressure. Canada's making some bold moves on the global stage - [Mark Carney spoke](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/canada/carney-speech-davos-trump.html) at Davos yesterday with what sounds like a pretty direct message about Canada's place in the world, even as Trump's territorial ambitions loom large. Speaking of which, Trump's finally [heading to Davos](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news) after an electrical issue delayed his departure, and his Greenland obsession is creating some serious headaches for NATO allies.

The Davos drama isn't just symbolic - it's reflecting real fractures in the transatlantic relationship that could reshape everything from trade to security cooperation. Meanwhile, back in Washington, the Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump can [fire Fed officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-fed-cook.html) at will, which would be a pretty massive shift in how monetary policy works. All of this is happening while his EPA has literally [valued human life](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/climate/epa-human-life-value.html) at zero dollars in new regulatory calculations - a stark signal about where environmental policy is headed.

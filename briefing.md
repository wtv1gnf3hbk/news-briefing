Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The U.S.-Mexico border is making headlines for an unexpected reason. A [Border Agency laser](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/trump-administration-el-paso-airspace-closure-questions.html) designed to take down drones apparently caused the shutdown of El Paso's airspace this week. The incident highlights a growing challenge as the Trump administration ramps up border enforcement: [anti-drone weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/weapons-used-to-fight-drones-dont-mix-well-with-civilian-airspace.html) don't play nicely with commercial aviation.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh wrapped up voting in what could be a watershed election. Al Jazeera reports that [polls closed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/12/bangladesh-election-results-live-polls-formally-close-counting-under-way) with counting now underway in the first democratic contest since Gen Z-led protests toppled Sheikh Hasina's authoritarian government. It's the kind of moment that could reshape South Asian politics, with voters hoping for a genuine return to democratic governance after 15 years of increasingly repressive rule.

**Business/Tech**
- [SoftBank swung](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-12/softbank-swings-to-profit-on-valuation-boost-from-its-openai-bet) back to quarterly profit, with its OpenAI bet generating nearly $20 billion in investment gains, Bloomberg reports. That's a massive vindication for Masayoshi Son's latest AI gamble.
- Amateur traders are [outpredicting Wall Street](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/business/economy/forecasts-prediction-markets-economy.html) Ph.D.s on economic forecasts, using prediction markets to beat traditional analysts at their own game.
- Instagram's head testified that social media isn't ["clinically addictive"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/technology/adam-mosseri-instagram-addiction-trial.html) in a landmark trial that could reshape how we think about tech platforms and mental health.
- [OpenAI's biggest challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/technology/openai-revenue-challenge.html) isn't building better AI models but figuring out how to turn all that technological prowess into sustainable revenue streams.

**Around the World**
- **Latin America:** A top U.S. energy official is [pressing Venezuela](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/world/americas/us-venezuela-foreign-investment-oil.html) to do more to encourage foreign investment, particularly in its oil sector, as Washington tries to balance sanctions with energy market stability.
- **Europe:** Former U.S. ambassadors and generals are [defending NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/12/world/europe/nato-us.html) as vital to American security, pushing back against any suggestion the alliance has outlived its usefulness.
- **Asia:** South Korea's spy agency says Kim Jong Un has [chosen his teenage daughter](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0e1g7kwglo) as his heir, according to the BBC. Ki Ju Ae's increasingly prominent public role apparently signals her position in the succession plan.
- **Middle East:** [Hamas would keep](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/middleeast/hamas-weapons-draft-plan.html) some weapons initially under a draft Gaza plan being discussed by officials, suggesting the group isn't ready for complete disarmament even in a potential ceasefire deal.
- **Africa:** Two Senegalese celebrities were [arrested in a crackdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/world/africa/senegal-gay-arrests-diallo-drame.html) on homosexuality, highlighting the ongoing persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals across much of the continent.

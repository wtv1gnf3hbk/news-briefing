Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's [Davos appearance](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news) is dominating global headlines, but not necessarily for the reasons organizers hoped. The president's wide-ranging address touched everything from his designs on Greenland to sharp rebukes of Canada, creating the kind of diplomatic ripples that have become his trademark. What's striking is how quickly his territorial ambitions have become [Europe's "No. 1 Priority"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/greenland-ukraine-nato-rutte.html) according to NATO leadership, potentially reshaping the alliance's focus just as the Ukraine war continues.

The broader context here is fascinating. As Europe scrambles to respond to Trump's pressure campaign, we're seeing traditional diplomatic norms get tossed aside in favor of more transactional approaches. Meanwhile, [Trump's confusion](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news#trump-greenland-iceland-confusion) between Greenland and Iceland at one point underscores how these high-stakes territorial discussions can sometimes veer into the surreal. The ripple effects are already visible in markets, where energy stocks are surging on geopolitical uncertainty, according to Bloomberg.

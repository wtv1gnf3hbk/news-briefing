Good morning Adam. Here's the state of play:

The big story today is Trump ramping up his confrontation with Europe as he heads to Davos, with his [Greenland threats](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/europe/davos-trump-europe.html) now triggering serious pushback from European leaders and market jitters. What started as seemingly outlandish territorial ambitions is now looking more like a calculated pressure campaign that's putting real strain on transatlantic relations. European officials are [pushing back](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news) hard, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas questioning Trump's trustworthiness, per the BBC.

The market reaction tells you how seriously investors are taking this. [U.S. stocks](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news#stocks-trump-greenland-tariffs) tumbled yesterday on renewed tariff fears, and volatility gauges are jumping as Trump's threats spook investors, per Reuters. Meanwhile, Canada's prime minister is calling this a ["rupture"](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news#carney-davos-speech-world-economic-forum) in the world order at Davos. It's shaping up to be a defining moment for how Trump's second term will reshape global relationships - and whether his [use of power](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/us/politics/trump-oval-office-world-leaders.html) on the world stage will bring results or chaos.

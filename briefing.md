Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Jeffrey Epstein files are sending shockwaves through Washington and beyond today. A [former police chief](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/trump-epstein.html) says Trump told him back in 2006 that "everyone" knew about Epstein's behavior when Florida authorities were investigating the financier. The revelations don't stop there. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has acknowledged [traveling to Epstein's island](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/howard-lutnick-jeffrey-epstein-island.html), while new documents show Epstein worked to [build ties with Russian officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/business/epstein-files-russia-putin.html) and directed an aide to [obtain hidden cameras](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/epstein-hidden-cameras.html).

The fallout is already beginning. Pop star Chappell Roan [left her talent agency](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/arts/music/chappell-roan-casey-wasserman-epstein-agency.html) after its founder appeared in the Epstein files, while new details emerge about how Epstein [used donations to wield influence](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/nyregion/epstein-columbia-nyu-donations-admission-young-women.html) at Columbia and NYU. Meanwhile, there's fresh scrutiny on how the financier worked to [build relationships with British political figures](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/europe/ties-peter-mandelson-jeffrey-epstein.html), including current U.S. ambassador-designate Peter Mandelson.

**Business/Tech**
- YouTube is making an unusual argument in a landmark tech addiction trial, claiming it [isn't social media](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/youtube-social-media-addiction-trial.html) at all. The distinction matters for potential liability in lawsuits alleging platforms harm kids.
- The top U.S. labor regulator [dismissed a complaint](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/business/spacex-nlrb-labor-elon-musk.html) against SpaceX, a victory for Elon Musk as his companies face multiple regulatory battles under the new administration.
- AI companies are quietly creating a [personalized internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/personaltech/ai-google-meta-opt-out.html) for you, and there's precious little you can do to opt out of their algorithmic choices.
- Bloomberg reports that uniform companies [UniFirst and Cintas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-10/uniform-makers-unifirst-cintas-renew-takeover-talks) are back in takeover talks after years of on-and-off negotiations.

**Around the World**
- **Latin America**: Trump's threats against Cuba's oil suppliers are putting Mexico in an uncomfortable position, forcing the country to [choose between](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/americas/mexico-cuba-oil.html) supporting its Caribbean neighbor and avoiding U.S. economic retaliation.
- **Europe**: Italian journalists are [going on strike](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/europe/olympics-italy-rai-broadcaster-gaffe-strike.html) after a state TV anchor repeatedly mangled celebrity identifications during Winter Olympics coverage, embarrassing the host nation on the global stage.
- **Asia**: Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit to Australia has created what officials call a "[tinder box](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/australia/australia-herzog-protest-violence.html)" of tensions, with pro-Palestinian protests turning violent in several cities.
- **Middle East**: A draft Gaza plan would allow Hamas to [keep some weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/middleeast/hamas-weapons-draft-plan.html) initially, according to officials familiar with the negotiations, marking a potential shift in ceasefire talks.
- **Africa**: Senegal has arrested [two celebrities](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/world/africa/senegal-gay-arrests-diallo-drame.html) in what activists are calling an escalating crackdown on homosexuality, raising concerns about LGBTQ rights in the West African nation.

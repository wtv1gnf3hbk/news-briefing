Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The White House is scrambling to distance Trump from the administration's initial response to a fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, as the political fallout intensifies. The [shooting has sparked](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/26/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice) widespread protests and put Democrats in the unusual position of embracing a potential government shutdown fight they'd normally want to avoid. What started as an immigration enforcement operation has morphed into a broader crisis of confidence for ICE and Border Patrol, with some federal agents now expected to leave the city.

The domestic political drama comes as the U.S. faces mounting international tensions. American warships are moving closer to Iranian waters, prompting [Tehran and its allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/us-warships-gulf-waters-iran-retaliation-threats.html) to ramp up retaliation threats. It's a familiar escalation cycle, but one that's playing out as Trump's foreign policy team is still getting its bearings. Meanwhile, a massive winter storm is wreaking havoc across multiple states, disrupting air travel and leaving thousands without power.

**Business/Tech**

• Silicon Valley's having its own reckoning over the Minneapolis shootings, with [tech workers seething](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/technology/ice-minnesota-protests-tech.html) even as their bosses continue courting Trump. The tension between corporate strategy and employee sentiment is getting harder to manage.

• The EU is opening an inquiry into Elon Musk's X over [sexualized A.I. images](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/european-union-x-grok-ai-images-musk.html) generated by the platform's Grok chatbot. It's another regulatory headache for Musk's already embattled social media platform.

• Gold just [hit $5,000](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/gold-extends-gains-above-5-000-as-debasement-trade-gathers-pace) an ounce for the second day running, according to Bloomberg. The so-called "debasement trade" is gathering steam as investors flee sovereign bonds and currencies.

• Asian markets are dipping after Trump threatened [new tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/asian-stocks-to-drift-higher-yen-gains-on-dollar-markets-wrap) on South Korean goods, Bloomberg reports. Just when investors thought they had a handle on Trump's trade policy, he's keeping them guessing.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Venezuela's opening up its economy but keeping everything else locked down tight. The country is [freeing markets](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-economy-rodriguez.html) while maintaining its iron grip on political dissent, creating a strange hybrid model that's worth watching.

• **Europe**: NATO's secretary-general delivered some harsh truths, telling Europeans they're ["dreaming" if they think](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/europe/nato-chief-europe-greenland-trump-us.html) they can defend themselves without American help. It's a blunt assessment that cuts right to the heart of transatlantic security debates.

• **Asia**: Japan's [panda fans](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/japan-pandas-china.html) are saying goodbye to their beloved furry diplomats as the animals head back to China. It sounds cute, but panda diplomacy is serious business in East Asian relations.

• **Middle East**: Israel says it's recovered the remains of the [last captive](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/gaza-hostage-returned-israel.html) in Gaza, potentially closing a painful chapter. The country also announced it will reopen the crucial Gaza-Egypt border crossing within days.

• **Africa**: A South African court ruled that [Nelson Mandela memorabilia](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html) can proceed to auction, settling a dispute that had cultural and financial implications for the anti-apartheid icon's legacy.

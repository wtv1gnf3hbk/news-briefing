Good morning. Here's the state of play:

After more than a year of grinding warfare, Russia appears to be on the verge of [capturing key towns](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/europe/russia-ukraine-battlefield-huliaipole-pokrovsk.html) in eastern Ukraine, including strategic positions near Huliaipole and Pokrovsk. These gains would represent some of Moscow's most significant territorial advances since the early months of the invasion, potentially giving Russian forces better supply lines and launching points for future operations.

The human cost of the prolonged conflict is becoming increasingly stark in Ukraine's cities. In Kyiv, residents are resorting to sleeping in [tents inside](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/europe/ukraine-war-russia-power-cold.html) their own beds to stay warm as power outages leave much of the capital without heat during the brutal winter months. It's a vivid reminder of how the war continues to reshape daily life far from the front lines.

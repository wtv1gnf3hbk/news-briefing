Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The [shooting aftermath](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/shooting-dhs-turmoil.html) in Minneapolis is throwing the entire Department of Homeland Security into chaos, with pressure mounting on ICE after a federal judge said the agency violated nearly 100 court orders. This isn't just about one tragic incident anymore. It's becoming a broader reckoning with how immigration enforcement operates under the Trump administration, and it's got lawmakers scrambling to avoid a government shutdown as Democrats push to strip DHS funding unless major reforms are implemented.

Meanwhile, the ripple effects are being felt internationally. [Starmer and Xi](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/china-starmer-xi-jinping.html) are trying to chart a path forward that sidesteps American volatility, with the UK securing visa-free travel to China as both leaders look for ways to work around an increasingly unpredictable U.S. And Trump's latest [threat against Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html) of a "massive armada" has Tehran warning of quick retaliation, putting the region on edge once again.

• **Africa**: [South Africa's facing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html) new scrutiny from Washington after conducting naval drills with Iran, putting Pretoria in an uncomfortable position between its non-aligned foreign policy and U.S. pressure.

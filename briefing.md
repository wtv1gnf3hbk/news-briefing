Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Republicans are building a massive fundraising advantage heading into the midterms, threatening to overwhelm Democratic candidates with cash in what's shaping up to be a pivotal election cycle. The [GOP's financial edge](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/republicans-democrats-midterms-fund-raising.html) comes as several key races are taking shape, including Susan Collins' announcement that she'll [seek re-election](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/susan-collins-maine-senate-2026.html) in Maine, a seat Democrats desperately need to flip to maintain any hope of Senate control.

The political landscape is shifting rapidly elsewhere too. In New Jersey, progressive activist Mejia has [defeated incumbent](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/nyregion/new-jersey-special-election-winner.html) Tom Malinowski in a special election, while Antonio Delgado has [dropped out](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/nyregion/antonio-delgado-drops-out-governor-new-york.html) of New York's gubernatorial race entirely. These shifts reflect broader tensions within the Democratic party as it grapples with Trump's immigration enforcement policies, which continue to draw [strong Republican support](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/trump-ice-immigration-polls-republicans.html) in polling.

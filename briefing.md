Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The big story emerging from Davos is how Canada's positioning itself as a credible alternative to American leadership just as Trump takes the stage. Finance Minister Mark Carney's pitch to global elites wasn't subtle. He's essentially arguing that [Canada can lead](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/canada/carney-speech-davos-trump.html) where America won't, particularly on climate and trade stability. It's a remarkable moment for a country that usually punches below its weight diplomatically.

Meanwhile, Trump's own [Davos appearance](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news) is doing exactly what you'd expect. He's touting the U.S. economy while taking shots at Europe, and his Greenland ambitions are serious enough that they're actually [rattling markets](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/greenland-stocks-bonds-dollar-gold.html). Investors are trying to price in scenarios that would have seemed absurd just months ago. The fact that we're even discussing congressional constraints on territorial expansion tells you everything about where we are.

• **Latin America**: The U.S. raid that apparently removed Maduro from power isn't generating the anti-American backlash you might expect. According to polling, [Latin Americans' hatred](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html) of the Venezuelan dictator is so intense it's drowning out concerns about sovereignty violations.

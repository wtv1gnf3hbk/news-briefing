Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's [Fed chair pick](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/business/kevin-warsh-fed-chair.html) Kevin Warsh is walking into one of the most challenging moments for monetary policy in recent memory. It's not just about managing inflation or employment anymore. Warsh will need to navigate Trump's political pressures while markets are already betting against American assets in ways we haven't seen in years. Wall Street traders are literally [selling America](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/business/sell-america-dollar-financial-markets.html) as a trade right now, which tells you something about confidence in the economic direction.

The tension between Trump's economic team is already showing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent might find himself at odds with a more hawkish Fed chair, creating the kind of policy discord that markets hate. Meanwhile, the [loyalty test](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/business/kevin-hassett-trump-loyalty-fed.html) that sidelined economist Kevin Hassett shows how Trump's prioritizing personal allegiance over technocratic expertise, even for the world's most important central bank.

**Business/Tech**

• [OpenAI's hunting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html) for up to $100 billion in new funding, which would cement its position as the most valuable startup ever and show just how much cash the AI race is consuming

• The AI boom is about to hit your wallet in a new way. All those [memory chips](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/ai-memory-chips-pc-smartphone.html) needed for AI processing are driving up the cost of regular PCs and smartphones for everyone else

• [Amazon and Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/amazon-google-nvidia-chips-competition.html) are finally making real headway against Nvidia's AI chip dominance, which could reshape the entire semiconductor landscape

• Tesla's [Model S](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/business/tesla-model-s-history.html) is getting discontinued after transforming the entire auto industry. It's the end of an era for the car that proved electric vehicles could be desirable

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: The [UN's warning](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/americas/un-finances-collapse-debts.html) of financial collapse due to unpaid dues is hitting at the worst possible time, with global crises demanding more international coordination than ever. Venezuela just announced an [amnesty bill](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPSkJCRDdkdHdNNllyM0xXX21XT2xMZEpoWWE2cDZTTDBpQVBrYWRNOC1NT0ZrSFgtVC1OR0M1UERZM1laQVFFVWJzOXNYc2xYMU9nVldNanhSby0wclRoVEhYMXozRkF3cGgxWm0tdER5NDhxbGFGQ3Y1cXpmcE5oclRMWVRhYzViTlpwdXkwWVRCSzBxaHh6MHBhZHpKQjFUeUxwMEZqdnlFQ0o1eXhiYmcyRXQ5M29NbllOQQ?oc=5) that could free thousands of political prisoners, per AP.

• **Europe**: [Russia's oil revenue](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/world/europe/russia-economy-oil.html) is plummeting, which strikes at the financial foundation of Putin's war machine. EU leaders are using the moment to try reducing their dependence on Trump by [drawing closer](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/world/europe/eu-trump-greenland-europe.html) to each other, though it's happening over some very awkward diplomatic dinners.

• **Asia**: Trump's trade warnings are reshaping alliances in ways that favor Beijing. [U.S. allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/world/asia/trump-xi-starmer-carney.html) are drawing closer to China, but crucially, they're doing it on Beijing's terms rather than as an equal partnership. It's exactly what Chinese strategists have been hoping for.

• **Middle East**: The [Rafah crossing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/world/middleeast/gaza-medical-evacuation-rafah-crossing.html) might finally provide a lifeline for Gaza's most desperate medical cases, even as Israel killed 28 Palestinians today in what Al Jazeera calls [new ceasefire breaches](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/1/31/live-israel-kills-12-palestinians-in-gaza-as-rafah-crossing-set-to-open). Syria's new government just [reached a deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/middleeast/syria-kurd-sdf-agreement.html) with Kurdish forces to merge their militias, which could stabilize the northeast.

• **Africa**: [Devastating floods](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/africa/mozambique-south-africa-flood.html) have displaced hundreds of thousands across Mozambique and South Africa, showcasing the region's vulnerability to extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent.

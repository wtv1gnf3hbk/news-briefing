Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Washington is wrestling with a [Homeland Security funding](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/us/politics/tsa-homeland-security-shutdown.html) crisis that could disrupt TSA operations and other critical security functions. The standoff reflects broader tensions over immigration enforcement and border security priorities. Meanwhile, the administration is facing pushback on multiple fronts, from student [protests against ICE](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/us/student-protests-walkouts-ice-texas.html) operations to questions about [secret deportations](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/world/africa/us-secret-deportation-cameroon.html) that allegedly bypassed legal protections.

The domestic political landscape is getting more contentious as Trump's influence continues to reshape Republican messaging around elections and voter access. The broader implications of this shift are playing out in state-level battles over [election security](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/us/politics/trump-elections-midterms-voter-id.html) measures that critics say could restrict voting rights.

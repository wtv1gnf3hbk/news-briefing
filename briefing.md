Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration's border security operations are under scrutiny after what appears to be a significant operational mishap at El Paso International Airport. The [Border Patrol's use](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/trump-administration-el-paso-airspace-closure-questions.html) of anti-drone laser technology apparently triggered the closure of civilian airspace, highlighting how [counter-drone weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/weapons-used-to-fight-drones-dont-mix-well-with-civilian-airspace.html) can create unintended complications when deployed near busy airports. AP sources confirm the Pentagon had authorized Customs and Border Protection to use the laser system before the FAA shut down the airspace.

Meanwhile, Trump's election security appointments continue raising eyebrows. The president has tapped an [election denier](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/12/us/politics/trump-kurt-olsen-election-denialism.html) to head election security efforts, while the House just passed a [strict voter ID](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/us/politics/house-passes-voter-id-bill.html) measure that amplifies Trump's fraud claims. It's part of a broader pattern of the administration reshaping election oversight in line with Trump's longstanding grievances about the 2020 race.

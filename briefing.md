Good morning. Here's the state of play:

[Crypto's taking](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/technology/bitcoin-price-drop-crypto-market.html) a beating despite Trump's vocal support, with Bitcoin sliding below $67,000 and dragging the whole digital asset market down with it. It's a reality check for anyone who thought presidential cheerleading alone could prop up speculative investments. The selloff is part of a broader tech rout that's got investors spooked about valuations across the board.

Meanwhile, Trump's continuing his federal workforce overhaul, [expanding his authority](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/05/us/trump-news) to fire career civil servants. It's the latest step in what looks like a systematic effort to reshape how the federal government operates. On Capitol Hill, [senators are clashing](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/us/politics/senate-immigration-enforcement-dhs-shutdown.html) over immigration enforcement funding, raising the specter of a Department of Homeland Security shutdown if they can't find common ground.

**Business/Tech**

• [Amazon's doubling down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/technology/amazon-200-billion-ai.html) with a $200 billion AI spending plan that puts serious money behind the artificial intelligence arms race. It's a massive bet that AI infrastructure will pay off in the long run.

• Tech stocks are getting hammered across Asia as the selloff that started in the U.S. spreads globally, according to Bloomberg. South Korean markets are taking it particularly hard.

• [Reddit's beating](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOLWl2QnR0RVY3UU1WWTVqMnVtWHNGMFRiUjhWS213UjV1OE9IT212b0F6b0RfZ3dxMjRfaWdkT3VZa2FkMUp6VXExOTAtMTdBSVVCU2lQamQ0VlRpVDFMbmRJalgyYnk4N0hmdVF6cURrcmJ1LUo1cU01eVlKMDEzLVN5aDl2N2pzVEw0WjdvRENDcFhfQ19Rdi05TlpYajRmRVNVc0ZqLWV5R1RPN05wVGdyUVgwbnlC?oc=5) revenue forecasts as AI tools help boost ad sales, per Reuters. At least someone's making money off the AI boom.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Mexico's [tequila mayor](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/americas/mexico-tequila-mayor-arrested.html) is in hot water, accused of shaking down the very tequila companies that put his town on the map. You really can't make this stuff up.

• **Europe**: Italy just [toughened protest laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/europe/italy-olympics-security-law-protests.html) hours before planned Winter Olympics rallies, creating a tense backdrop for what's supposed to be a celebration of international sport.

• **Asia**: Pakistan's military launched an operation that [displaced thousands](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/asia/pakistan-military-operation-displaced-people.html), but here's the twist: Islamabad claims it never ordered the offensive. The disconnect between military action and civilian authority is deeply troubling.

• **Middle East**: Iranian Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi has [started another hunger strike](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/middleeast/iran-narges-mohammadi-prison-hunger-strike.html) from prison, highlighting the regime's continued crackdown on dissent even as the BBC reports that US-Iran talks are set to begin.

• **Africa**: [Gunmen killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/africa/nigeria-attack-woro-nuku.html) more than 160 people in Nigeria, according to aid officials, another reminder of the security challenges plaguing parts of West Africa.

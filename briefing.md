Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Washington is grappling with a [Homeland Security funding](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/us/politics/tsa-homeland-security-shutdown.html) crisis that could affect everything from TSA operations to border security. The political standoff reflects broader tensions over immigration enforcement and government spending priorities that we've seen play out repeatedly this year.

The funding fight comes as the administration faces pushback on multiple fronts, from [student walkouts](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/us/student-protests-walkouts-ice-texas.html) protesting ICE operations to questions about [secret deportations](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/world/africa/us-secret-deportation-cameroon.html) that appear to have bypassed legal protections. There's also growing scrutiny of how federal agencies are using surveillance tools, with reports that Homeland Security wants social media platforms to hand over information about accounts critical of immigration enforcement.

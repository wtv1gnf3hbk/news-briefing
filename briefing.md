Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The U.S. is grappling with a series of domestic security challenges that have international implications. A [major debacle](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/us/politics/el-paso-airspace-closure-faa-pentagon.html) led to the complete closure of El Paso's airspace, highlighting coordination problems between the Pentagon and FAA over anti-drone operations along the Mexican border. The situation underscores broader tensions as the Department of Homeland Security has [shut down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/us/politics/dhs-shutdown-funding.html) due to funding disputes, leaving essential operations running but creating uncertainty for thousands of federal workers.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rubio is working to reassure European allies at the Munich Security Conference, where [world leaders](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/14/live-world-leaders-gather-in-munich-for-2nd-day-of-security-conference) are gathering for a second day of discussions. European officials are expressing [cautious relief](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/world/europe/europe-reaction-rubio.html) about Rubio's approach, though concerns remain about broader U.S. policy directions under the new administration.

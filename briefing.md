Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump isn't backing down on tariffs. After the Supreme Court struck down his initial global tariffs, he's now [raising them](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html) to 15 percent on all imports. The move shows he's determined to push forward with his trade agenda despite facing legal challenges and a [divided Supreme Court](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html) that could complicate his broader plans.

The fallout is creating what businesses are calling "[murky waters](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/tariffs-supreme-court-global-busines-reaction.html)" for global trade, while consumers are left in a [waiting game](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/tariff-ruling-consumer-prices.html) to see how prices will be affected. Meanwhile, Justice Gorsuch's concurrence in the Court's ruling contained what some are reading as a [subtle reproach](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/gorsuch-congress-trump-tariffs.html) of Congress for ceding too much power to the executive branch.

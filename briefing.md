Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Rev. [Jesse Jackson](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/us/jesse-jackson-dead.html), the charismatic civil rights leader who carried forward Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy for decades, has died at 84. Jackson's passing marks the end of an era for the American civil rights movement. He was a towering figure who ran for president twice, negotiated the release of hostages abroad, and never stopped pushing for racial and economic justice long after the movement's most famous victories.

The timing comes as U.S. and Iran [resume nuclear talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/us/politics/us-iran-nuclear-talks.html) for a second round in Switzerland, with tensions running high. Iran conducted [military exercises](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/world/middleeast/iran-strait-hormuz-exercise-talks-geneva-trump.html) in the Strait of Hormuz just as negotiations got underway, while Supreme Leader Khamenei took direct aim at Trump's approach to diplomacy, according to Al Jazeera. It's classic brinksmanship as both sides test each other's resolve.

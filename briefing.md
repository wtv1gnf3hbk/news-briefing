Good morning. Here's the state of play:

We're leading today with a deeply reported look at [Iran's brutal crackdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/middleeast/iran-protester-deaths.html) on protesters over recent years. The investigation puts human faces on what intelligence estimates suggest were thousands of deaths during various waves of unrest. It's particularly timely given the escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran.

Speaking of which, Trump's ramping up pressure on Iran in a big way. He's warning that ["time is running out"](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/trump-news) for a nuclear deal while moving what he calls a "massive armada" toward the Persian Gulf. Iran's responding with threats to retaliate "like never before," setting up what could be the most serious U.S.-Iran crisis in years. It's classic Trump brinkmanship, but with real stakes for regional stability.

The domestic picture remains dominated by the fallout from Minneapolis, where federal immigration enforcement has triggered [a political crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota) that's now reaching state legislatures nationwide. Even Trump's own team seems to be acknowledging something went wrong with the protocols that led to Alex Pretti's death.

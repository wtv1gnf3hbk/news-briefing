Good morning. Here's the state of play:

While international outlets are consumed by the Peter Mandelson-Epstein scandal (he's resigned from the Lords after police opened an investigation into alleged email leaks), the U.S. is fixated on something decidedly more surreal. A massive golden statue dubbed ["Don Colossus"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/technology/trump-statue-don-colossus.html) depicting Trump is sitting somewhere, waiting for a permanent home. It's the kind of story that captures how Trump's second presidency continues to blur the lines between politics and spectacle.

The more substantive story is Trump's [meeting with Colombia's president](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/colombia-petro-trump-meeting.html) at the White House today, as the administration tries to reset relations after tensions over deportation flights. Meanwhile, the immigration crackdown continues to dominate headlines, with [ongoing ICE operations](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/03/us/minneapolis-ice-immigration) in Minneapolis drawing particular scrutiny from federal oversight bodies and state attorneys general.

**Business/Tech**

• [Disney's named](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/disney-damaro-ceo.html) Josh D'Amaro as its next CEO, picking the theme parks chief to lead the entertainment giant through its next chapter. He's got experience turning around the post-pandemic parks business.

• Waymo just [raised $16 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/waymo-funding-growth.html) to fuel its global expansion plans. That's a massive bet on autonomous vehicles becoming mainstream sooner rather than later.

• Santander's making a [major U.S. play](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/santander-weighs-deal-to-buy-us-based-webster-financial), agreeing to buy Webster Financial for $12.2 billion according to Bloomberg. It's one of the largest U.S. deals ever by a European bank.

• Intel's CEO says the company [will make GPUs](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNcFhqZWNRMzZSY0xtWTVJeHdoMC1pemFYc3BRbnRXbWtOaTVKYWxadjlyS2dOVWVyOUN3WTRNSEhHblZwQXFOR1ZJSWR4dXdFdk5wZnpGRTYzSW1ZdmZmSzJMd1g0dkpfNDdBNV9fRWw0aWQ2b216N2I4azZreVVnbUdTSGlmSzBmS2hES2hiNjI3em5pTTdPa2w3OWRUNi14ZWQ1SUEwOUFHX1k?oc=5), taking direct aim at Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. That's a bold move for a company that's been struggling to stay relevant.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Venezuela's authoritarian grip is showing signs of [loosening slightly](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/americas/venezuela-rodriguez-maduro-authoritarian.html), but the big question is whether this represents genuine reform or just tactical breathing room for Maduro's regime as it faces mounting pressure.

• **Europe**: Spain's prime minister wants to [ban social media](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/spain-social-media-ban-under-16.html) for kids under 16, following Australia's lead. It's part of a growing global movement to protect children from platforms that critics say are designed to be addictive.

• **Asia**: There are signs of serious [ruptures in China's leadership](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/china-xi-military-purge.html), possibly driven by Xi Jinping's paranoia and internal power struggles. Meanwhile, Japan's dealing with deadly winter weather that's [killed at least 30](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/asia/japan-snow-deaths.html) people.

• **Middle East**: Iran's president is backing ["fair" talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/middleeast/iran-president-talks-istanbul-witkoff-kushner.html) with the U.S. as tensions mount. It's a potentially significant opening, though Iran has made similar overtures before that led nowhere.

• **Africa**: Health officials are warning that ["biblical diseases"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/health/neglected-tropical-diseases-usaid-ntds-river-blindness.html) like river blindness could surge across the continent if global health funding gets cut. It's a reminder of how interconnected global health security really is.

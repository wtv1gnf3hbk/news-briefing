Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's confrontation with Harvard is over before it really began. The president [backed down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-payment.html) from his demand that the university pay cash to the government after facing stiff resistance from the school and its allies. It's a rare retreat for an administration that's been bulldozing through opposition on most fronts, and it suggests there are still some institutions with enough clout to make Trump think twice.

Meanwhile, the government shutdown drama continues to unfold on Capitol Hill. There's a [deal on paper](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/02/us/trump-news) between Senate Democrats and Trump, but House hard-liners are balking at the agreement, putting its passage in jeopardy. Trump is [pushing Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-nationalize-elections.html) to "nationalize" elections in what he's calling an escalation, while his intelligence chief apparently had to put him on the phone with FBI agents after a Georgia search operation went sideways.

The Epstein files continue to wreak havoc across the Atlantic, where Peter Mandelson's nomination as UK ambassador to Washington looks increasingly untenable. British media are leading with revelations that he may have shared government information with Epstein, and police are now reviewing misconduct claims. It's part of a broader pattern we're seeing where these documents are creating political headaches far beyond American shores.

• Trump's tariff experiment is getting its [one-year report card](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/trump-tariffs-one-year-later.html), and the results are mixed at best. Some sectors have seen protection, but consumers are definitely paying more for everyday goods.

• China's laying out its vision for [dominating AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/china-ai-regulations.html) while still obeying government rules. Beijing wants to move fast but maintain control, which is a tricky balance as the technology races ahead globally.

• NXP Semiconductors is [forecasting better times](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3AFBVV95cUxOTFJuRERfX3A4NC0xTVotSG5NdWRTeWtpSjRrRU1iUldKQzZtZTFVWVpibEZGeFVlM1NuSk1laENJcWNTbjVsWkJPZlE2bkp4eElLcllORWNvVjN5SFVWcGpPTjJsRG5BTUhydVpvSmVwaGFzSGpfZXExczdsS1d4SkxqanNCMU5xXzBZQlZXLXVfSWViYmNRSFJsV2JVcFlyYjItV2VHeVdPdkVQN2ptUUdjcEludXNmbjUwdjhPcmF0YXlhYW5qa09wcXdDcmFxOWJTQ0M3ZnFXRzU3?oc=5) ahead, suggesting the industrial market may have finally hit bottom, according to Reuters.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Colombia's president Gustavo Petro just [can't help himself](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/americas/colombia-petro-trump-white-house.html) when it comes to needling Trump, even with a White House meeting scheduled for later this week. His social media provocations are becoming a diplomatic liability.

• **Europe**: France's Prime Minister François Lecornu finally [cleared a major hurdle](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/europe/france-budget-lecornu.html) to pass a budget after months of political turmoil. It's a small victory for stability in a country that's been lurching from crisis to crisis.

• **Asia**: Trump announced a [trade deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-tariffs-india-trade-deal.html) with India that slashes tariffs from 50 percent to 18 percent. It's a significant win for Modi's government and suggests Trump's tariff threats can actually produce negotiations.

• **Middle East**: U.S. and Iranian officials are planning to [meet soon](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-meeting-trump-threats.html) as Trump's threats loom over the relationship. There's cautious optimism that diplomacy might prevail, even as tensions remain high over Iran's nuclear program.

• **Africa**: Egypt's been running a [secret air base](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html) that's fueling Sudan's devastating drone war. The investigation reveals how regional powers are quietly escalating conflicts across the continent.

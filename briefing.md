Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Epstein saga took another turn yesterday as the [Clintons agreed](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/clintons-epstein-testify.html) to testify before Congress, prompting House leaders to cancel their contempt vote. It's a significant development in what's become a sprawling investigation touching multiple countries. The fallout continues rippling across the Atlantic, where London's Met Police have [launched an investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/03/met-police-to-launch-investigation-into-alleged-mandelson-epstein-email-leaks) into alleged email leaks involving Peter Mandelson, the UK's newly appointed ambassador to Washington.

The timing couldn't be more awkward for Keir Starmer's government, which is now defending Mandelson's appointment as questions swirl about his past connections. Meanwhile, new court documents reveal who would have inherited [Epstein's fortune](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/jeffrey-epstein-trust-inherit-karyna-shuliak.html), adding another layer to the unfolding story. It's becoming clear this isn't going away anytime soon.

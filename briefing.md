Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration's already complex web of business interests just got a new international dimension. A [U.A.E. firm](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html) quietly took a stake in the Trump family's crypto company, World Liberty Financial, raising fresh questions about foreign influence and conflicts of interest. The investment comes as the administration navigates delicate Gulf relationships and cryptocurrency regulation, making this exactly the kind of entanglement ethics experts have been warning about.

Meanwhile, there's a major political upset brewing in Texas that could signal trouble for Republicans heading into the midterms. A Democrat just [flipped a state Senate seat](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPeXlXVkEtcUpyaUs5ZHVSVE5MUFU3QVQwTXdDR19saGZIdmNTdFN4T0xfbWxPME93SUtDMG1vMUhjelFjYzJJbG5YNGZodXNfUmhfbkpPN2dNOS1paEh6OV90TzhRaERXSFRmdnhoRzZJY3IxVV9wN0ZucGxKS3lFdjdvUEJ2S0ZEb0xPMW50emQzdnpwazV6dkhjTF9CX2NUMExB?oc=5) that Trump carried by 17 points just two years ago. That's the kind of swing that has party strategists reaching for antacids.

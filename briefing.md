Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The United States is bracing for a potentially crippling winter storm that has officials across the South particularly worried about widespread ice accumulation. The [forecast shows](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/weather/winter-storm-ice-tennessee-carolina-mississippi.html) dangerous ice conditions stretching from Tennessee to the Carolinas and Mississippi, the kind of weather that can snap power lines and make roads impassable for days. It's a stark reminder of how unprepared much of the South's infrastructure is for severe winter weather.

Meanwhile, the domestic immigration enforcement story continues to evolve in ways that are creating real political friction. We're seeing everything from [massive protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/minnesota-businesses-protest-ice.html) in Minneapolis to an [ICE agent](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/ice-agent-charged-illinois.html) being charged with a misdemeanor in Illinois after a scuffle with an activist. There's also a troubling incident where someone was [pepper-sprayed while](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/minneapolis-man-pepper-sprayed-pinned-video.html) being held down by officers, sparking widespread outrage. The enforcement push is clearly generating the kind of confrontations that could complicate the administration's broader immigration agenda.

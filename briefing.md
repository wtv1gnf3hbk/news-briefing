Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration is considering a significant expansion of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, including resuming underground weapons tests for the first time since 1992, according to [NYT reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/us/politics/trump-nuclear-arms-underground-tests.html). The deliberations follow the expiration of New START, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with Russia, and reflect a shift toward building new warheads rather than maintaining the existing stockpile. No final decisions have been made, but officials say the discussions have accelerated.

Lai, a British citizen, is the most prominent figure convicted under the law. China signaled it would deepen its security focus in Hong Kong in the wake of the ruling, Bloomberg reports.

Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, called on [Starmer to resign](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/09/world/uk-starmer-resign-epstein-mandelson) over the appointment of Peter Mandelson — who had ties to Jeffrey Epstein — as ambassador to the United States. Starmer told Labour MPs he would not quit, per the Economist, vowing not to plunge Britain "into chaos." Separately, Ghislaine Maxwell [refused to answer](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv5yre39zo) questions from a congressional panel investigating Epstein, the BBC reports.

Israel has [expanded its control](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/world/middleeast/israel-settlements-west-bank.html) over the occupied West Bank, transferring authority over settlements from the military to a civilian government body.

Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The long saga over TikTok's future in America is finally over. [TikTok struck](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance-china-us.html) a deal to create a new U.S. entity that ends years of legal battles and national security concerns. The restructuring involves Oracle and other American investors taking significant stakes while ByteDance maintains some ownership. For the app's 170 million American users, the changes should be largely invisible, though the deal represents a major shift in how Chinese tech companies operate globally.

The resolution comes as Chinese firms are [searching for](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/business/tiktok-china-technology.html) new ways to expand internationally without triggering the kind of regulatory backlash that nearly killed TikTok. The precedent here could reshape how Beijing's tech giants approach Western markets, especially as U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer over technology and data security.

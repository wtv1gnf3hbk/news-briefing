Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump is doubling down on his trade agenda after yesterday's Supreme Court setback, announcing he'll [raise tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html) to 15 percent globally with immediate effect. This comes just hours after the Court struck down his initial 10 percent levies, creating what businesses are calling "[murky waters](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/tariffs-supreme-court-global-busines-reaction.html)" for global trade. The president is using Section 122 emergency powers to bypass the ruling, but he's facing [divisions among conservative justices](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html) that could complicate his broader economic agenda.

The escalation puts American consumers in a [waiting game](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/tariff-ruling-consumer-prices.html) over price impacts, while businesses scramble to adjust supply chains. Trump is also [closing loopholes](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-deminimis-loophole-closed.html) on cheap imports, targeting the de minimis threshold that allows small packages to enter duty-free.

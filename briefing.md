Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration is tightening the screws on Cuba with what amounts to a [new blockade](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/americas/cuba-oil-blockade-trump.html) that's cutting off oil supplies and strangling the island's already fragile economy. The strategy represents a return to maximum pressure tactics that go beyond the traditional embargo, targeting the energy lifeline that keeps Cuba functioning. It's the clearest sign yet of how Trump plans to handle leftist governments in the Americas during his second term.

Meanwhile, the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has blown up the British royal family in spectacular fashion. Former Prince Andrew was [arrested yesterday](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/europe/prince-andrew-arrest-epstein-royal-family-uk.html) in connection with the Epstein case, sending shockwaves through the monarchy that had hoped to move past his scandals. Police are [searching his mansion](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/europe/prince-andrew-search-epstein.html) for the second day running, while the palace scrambles to contain damage that threatens to overshadow King Charles's reign.

**Business/Tech**

• The [Defense Department](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/18/technology/defense-department-anthropic-ai-safety.html) and AI company Anthropic are in a public spat over artificial intelligence safety protocols, with the Pentagon pushing for fewer restrictions on military AI applications while the company digs in on its safety-first approach.

• [West Virginia](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/technology/apple-west-virginia-lawsuit-child-sexual-abuse.html) has filed a lawsuit claiming Apple's systems allow sharing of child sexual abuse material, escalating state-level pressure on tech companies over content moderation.

• The [FCC's equal-time rule](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/business/media/colbert-equal-time-fcc-brendan-carr.html) is causing headaches for late-night TV hosts, with Stephen Colbert and others having to navigate century-old broadcasting regulations that weren't designed for the Trump era.

• Bloomberg reports that [LyondellBasell](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-20/lyondellbasell-slashes-dividend-citing-challenging-markets) slashed its dividend by almost half, citing brutal market conditions in the chemicals sector.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Venezuelan lawmakers passed an [amnesty bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/world/americas/venezuela-amnesty-bill-prisoners.html) that critics are calling deeply flawed, raising questions about whether it will actually free political prisoners or just provide cover for the Maduro government.

• **Europe**: A whistle-blower claims the head of Russia's anti-doping agency was [directly involved](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/europe/olympics-doping-russia.html) in the 2014 Olympic doping scheme, potentially undermining Moscow's efforts to rehabilitate its sports reputation.

• **Asia**: Beijing is [stoking fear](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/asia/china-travel-japan-fear.html) about travel to Japan through state media campaigns, part of a broader effort to discourage Chinese tourism to its neighbor over political disputes.

• **Middle East**: Syria's new authorities have [banned makeup](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/middleeast/makeup-ban-women-syria.html) for women, the latest sign of how conservative religious interpretations are shaping post-Assad governance in Damascus.

• **Africa**: UN investigators found that attacks on the Sudanese city of El Fasher bore [hallmarks of genocide](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/world/africa/sudan-un-el-fasher-rsf.html), adding international legal weight to accusations against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

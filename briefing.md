Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The biggest story coming out of Davos isn't just Trump's trade threats, but the specific framework emerging around [Greenland talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/trump-greenland-deal-framework.html). We're hearing about potential U.S. sovereign military bases and explicit restrictions on Russian drilling rights. It's a far more concrete proposal than many expected, though [Denmark's pushing back](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/denmark-greenland-trump-us-reaction.html) hard on any sovereignty concessions. This isn't just posturing anymore.

Meanwhile, the broader transatlantic relationship is under serious strain. [Zelensky's lashing out](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/22/us/trump-davos-news) at European leaders in Davos, telling them they need to step up or risk being left behind as Trump reshapes global alliances. European officials are scrambling to figure out their approach, especially as Trump rolls out his [glittering Gaza plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/middleeast/us-gaza-peace-trump-kushner-davos.html) complete with skyscraper developments. The question isn't whether Trump will disrupt the old order, it's how quickly he'll replace it.

• **Europe**: [Putin's dangling](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/putin-board-of-peace-frozen-assets.html) the possibility that Russia could contribute to Trump's "Board of Peace" if the U.S. unfreezes Russian assets, a typically cynical move that puts the ball back in Washington's court.

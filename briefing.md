Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The [Don Lemon arrest](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/don-lemon-arrest-minnesota-church-protest.html) at a Minnesota church protest is capturing attention this morning, but it's really part of a much bigger story about how Trump's immigration crackdown is playing out on the ground. The former CNN host's detention during an anti-ICE demonstration shows how these protests are drawing high-profile figures into direct confrontation with federal authorities. Meanwhile, we're also getting a massive [Epstein document dump](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/30/us/epstein-files-release) from the Justice Department today - more than three million pages that could shed new light on the financier's connections to powerful figures.

What's particularly striking is how the Minnesota situation is becoming a test case for American federalism. The state's resistance to federal immigration enforcement has created [real tensions](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/magazine/minnesota-investigation-state-federalism.html) about how our system of government actually works when Washington and state capitals are pulling in opposite directions. It's not just about immigration policy anymore - it's about whether the federal system itself can hold together under this kind of pressure.

• [OpenAI's reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html) in talks to raise up to $100 billion, which would make it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The AI arms race isn't slowing down.

• Kevin Warsh's nomination to lead the Fed is already [moving markets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/us-stocks-slide-after-trump-s-fed-chair-pick-hotter-ppi-data) - the dollar's having its best day since July as traders bet he'll take a more hawkish stance than Powell.

• The [Washington Post is planning](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/media/washington-post-newsroom.html) significant newsroom cuts as it tries to reshape itself financially. Another sign of the ongoing struggles in traditional media.

• Tech companies are already helping ICE track protesters through [facial recognition and data](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/technology/tech-ice-facial-recognition-palantir.html) from firms like Palantir, showing how surveillance capabilities are being deployed in real-time.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Argentina's in [advanced talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/americas/argentina-us-deportations-immigrants-milei.html) to become a destination for U.S. deportations under Trump's immigration crackdown. Milei's government sees an opportunity to strengthen ties with Washington, but it could create serious domestic political challenges.

• **Europe**: The Netherlands is getting [a new government](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/europe/netherlands-government-rob-jetten.html), but whether it'll actually last is the real question. Dutch politics has been notoriously unstable lately, and this coalition faces some serious challenges from day one.

• **Asia**: A [crying toy horse](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/asia/crying-horse-toy-china.html) born from a factory mistake has become an unlikely symbol of China's current mood. Sometimes the most random cultural phenomena capture something deeper about a country's psychological state.

• **Middle East**: Syria's new government just sealed [a deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/middleeast/syria-kurd-sdf-agreement.html) with Kurdish-led militias to merge their forces. It's a significant step toward consolidating control after Assad's fall, but the details of how this actually works will be crucial.

• **Africa**: Devastating floods have [displaced hundreds of thousands](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/africa/mozambique-south-africa-flood.html) across southern Africa, according to Reuters. The scale of the displacement shows how climate disasters continue to create massive humanitarian challenges across the region.

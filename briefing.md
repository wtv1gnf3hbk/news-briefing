Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The most surprising story today isn't coming from traditional newsrooms but from prediction markets, where [amateur gamblers](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/business/economy/forecasts-prediction-markets-economy.html) are consistently outperforming Wall Street's most credentialed economists. These everyday traders, betting small amounts on economic outcomes, have been more accurate at forecasting everything from inflation rates to employment numbers than PhD economists at major investment banks. It's a fascinating glimpse into how crowdsourced wisdom might be reshaping how we think about economic forecasting.

Meanwhile, Canada is grappling with one of its [deadliest mass shootings](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/world/canada/canada-shooting-tumbler-ridge-british-columbia.html) in recent history. Nine people were killed and 25 injured in attacks at a school and residence in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia. Students and teachers barricaded themselves in classrooms for hours during the ordeal. The tragedy comes despite Canada's significant gun control reforms following its 2020 mass shooting.

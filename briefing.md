Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration is facing a deepening crisis of confidence as [ICE and Border Patrol](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/ice-border-patrol-trust.html) operations spark increasingly violent confrontations. The latest flashpoint is in Minneapolis, where federal agents have killed two people in recent weeks, including an ICU nurse whose friends and family are [denouncing lies](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/us/alex-pretti-minneapolis-shooting.html) being spread about his life. The administration's [rushed response](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/us/politics/trump-administration-minneapolis-shooting-response.html) to the shootings has only inflamed tensions, while [Minnesota is fighting back](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/minnesota-lawsuit-ice-surge-hearing.html) in federal court today, claiming the ICE surge is illegal.

Meanwhile, Mother Nature is delivering her own chaos. A massive [winter storm](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/26/weather/weather-snow-updates-ice-cold) continues pummeling the U.S. with ice, snow, and frigid temperatures, dumping [a foot of snow](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/us/snow-totals.html) across at least 17 states. It's a real test for infrastructure and emergency services already stretched thin.

**Business/Tech**

• [Gold surged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-25/gold-tops-5-000-as-global-upheaval-fuels-precious-metals-rally) past $5,000 for the first time ever as global upheaval sends investors fleeing to safe havens, according to Bloomberg. The precious metal's rally reflects just how unsettled markets are about Trump's reshaping of international relations.

• The [Washington Post](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/business/media/washington-post-winter-olympics.html) scrapped its plans to cover the Winter Olympics, another sign of the media industry's budget pressures as newsrooms continue cutting back on major international coverage.

• [TikTok struck](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance-china-us.html) a deal for a new U.S. entity that finally ends its long legal saga, though questions remain about who really controls the platform now.

• Mississippi Delta farmers are considering [letting crops rot](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/business/mississippi-delta-farmers-rice-prices.html) as rice prices collapse, showing how trade disruptions are hitting agricultural communities hard.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America:** Venezuela's government is [liberalizing the economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-economy-rodriguez.html) while keeping everything else locked down tight. It's a fascinating experiment in selective reform that's creating strange contradictions for ordinary Venezuelans.

• **Europe:** The EU [opened an investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/european-union-x-grok-ai-images-musk.html) into Elon Musk's X over sexualized AI images generated by its Grok chatbot. Brussels is clearly not backing down from its tech regulation fights, even with Musk's increased political influence.

• **Asia:** Xi Jinping just demonstrated that [even top generals](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/china-xi-zhang-youxia-military.html) can fall from grace in today's China, as another high-ranking military official gets purged. It's a reminder of how thoroughly Xi has consolidated power.

• **Middle East:** Iran's security apparatus is showing real cracks after [crushing citizen uprisings](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/world/middleeast/iran-how-crackdown-was-done.html) with lethal force. The regime's brutal tactics may have worked in the short term, but they've left the ayatollah and Revolutionary Guards looking more fragile than ever.

• **Africa:** A South African court ruled that [Nelson Mandela memorabilia](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html) can go to auction, settling a dispute over whether these historical artifacts belong in private collections or public institutions.

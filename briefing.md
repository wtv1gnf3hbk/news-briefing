Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Federal immigration enforcement is spinning dangerously out of control in Minneapolis, where ICE agents have now killed two US citizens in less than a week. The [second fatal shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/politics/second-ice-shooting-minneapolis.html) has prompted Minnesota's governor to deploy the National Guard as protests intensify. What's particularly damning is that [videos appear](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice) to contradict federal agents' accounts of what happened, raising serious questions about accountability in Trump's immigration crackdown.

Meanwhile, Mother Nature's delivering her own crisis as a [major storm](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/25/us/winter-storm-snow-ice) barrels toward the Northeast with potentially crippling snow and ice. We're talking about a foot of snow for New York City and widespread power outages that have already triggered grid emergencies across multiple states. The timing couldn't be worse for a country already dealing with political turmoil.

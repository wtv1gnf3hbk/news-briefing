Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The violence in Minneapolis has escalated dramatically. Representative [Ilhan Omar was attacked](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/ilhan-omar-town-hall-minnesota.html) at a town hall meeting, adding fuel to already dangerous tensions following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents. The Trump administration is clearly feeling the heat here. A senior aide suggested agents may not have [followed protocol](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html) in the shooting, while Trump himself is scrambling to contain the political damage. The broader stakes are significant: state legislators across the country are moving to [restrict ICE operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html) in response to the Minneapolis crisis.

Meanwhile, Trump is ramping up pressure on Iran with threats of a "massive armada" and [new demands](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html), telling Tehran that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal. Iran has responded defiantly, saying it will "respond like never before" to U.S. threats. This escalation comes as intelligence briefings reportedly suggest Iran's government is in a weakened state, which may be emboldening Trump's approach. Oil markets are already reacting, with prices hitting four-month highs.

Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration's immigration crackdown is creating ripple effects far beyond enforcement operations themselves. In Minneapolis, children are staying home from school en masse as families fear ICE raids, creating what amounts to a [winter of anguish](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/minneapolis-children-ice-schools.html) for kids caught in the crosshairs of federal policy. The scene captures something larger about how immigration enforcement reshapes entire communities, not just the families directly targeted.

This isn't happening in isolation. The administration is also pushing to ["nationalize" elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/trump-save-act-elections.html), though the White House keeps walking back Trump's more sweeping statements. Meanwhile, international outlets are fixated on newly released [Epstein documents](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cl7003r72r4t) that are dragging prominent figures back into uncomfortable scrutiny. It's a moment when domestic policy turbulence meets ongoing revelations about powerful people's past associations.

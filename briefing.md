Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Pakistan launched deadly strikes on Afghanistan overnight, marking a dangerous escalation in cross-border tensions. According to [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/22/pakistan-carries-out-strikes-in-afghanistan-after-islamabad-suicide-attack), Pakistan says the attacks were retaliation for recent suicide bombings, but Afghanistan is promising an "appropriate response." This is exactly the kind of tit-for-tat escalation that can spiral quickly in a region where both countries are dealing with internal security crises.

The other big story is Iran's ongoing standoff with the US. Students at Iranian universities held their [first large protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/middleeast/iran-student-protests.html) since the regime's brutal crackdown last month, while President Pezeshkian said Iran won't bow to US pressure in nuclear talks. Meanwhile, Trump is [considering strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/us/politics/trump-iran-military-strikes.html) on Iran even as his tariff powers got clipped by the Supreme Court. The Court ruling may have [strengthened Xi's hand](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-22/xi-gains-upper-hand-before-trump-summit-after-us-tariff-reversal) ahead of his planned summit with Trump, but it doesn't change the Iran calculus much.

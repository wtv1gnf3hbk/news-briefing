Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The big story from Davos is [China's ascent](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/business/davos-trump-xi-china.html) as the dominant economic power while Trump steps back from global leadership. It's a striking reversal from the usual American-led world order, and it's playing out on the biggest stage in international business. Meanwhile, Trump's hosting a "[Board of Peace](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/22/us/trump-davos-news)" signing ceremony, though the details of what that actually means remain fuzzy.

The transatlantic relationship is getting even messier. [Trump's rift](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/trump-rift-europe.html) with Europe is now impossible to ignore, and European leaders are scrambling to figure out their next moves. The [Greenland situation](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-greenland-threats-diplomacy-force.html) has NATO allies particularly worried as Trump pushes his sovereignty framework. And there's movement on Ukraine, with [Zelensky meeting Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/us/politics/zelensky-trump-davos-ukraine-peace-deal.html) to discuss a potential peace deal.

**Business/Tech**

• [Japan's nuclear](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/business/japan-nuclear-offline.html) restart hit a snag when a malfunction forced them to take a recently restarted plant offline again. It's another setback for the country's post-Fukushima nuclear revival plans.

• Job applicants are [suing companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/ai-hiring-tools-lawsuit-eightfold-fcra.html) to crack open the "black box" of AI hiring decisions. The lawsuit against Eightfold could set important precedents for algorithmic transparency in recruitment.

• Turkey's central bank surprised markets by [cutting rates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/turkey-lowers-key-interest-rate-to-37-in-fifth-straight-cut) less aggressively than expected, according to Bloomberg. The smaller cut to 37% suggests they might be getting more cautious about their easing cycle.

• [Snap settled](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/snap-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html) a major social media addiction lawsuit just before what would have been a landmark trial. The terms weren't disclosed, but it avoids what could have been a precedent-setting case.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Most Latin Americans actually [supported Trump's raid](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html) in Venezuela, according to new polling. It's a fascinating glimpse into how the region views both Maduro and American intervention.

• **Europe**: Trump's sending his envoys [Witkoff and Kushner](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/putin-meeting-witkoff-kushner-moscow-us-russia.html) to meet with Putin for Ukraine talks. It's the first high-level U.S.-Russia diplomatic contact since Trump took office.

• **Asia**: A Filipino journalist just got [prison time](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/asia/philippines-cumpio-journalist-prison.html) in what press freedom groups are calling a direct attack on independent media. The Duterte-era crackdown on journalism continues under Marcos Jr.

• **Middle East**: Rifaat al-Assad, known as the "[Butcher of Hama](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/middleeast/rifaat-al-assad-dead.html)," died at 88. The uncle of ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was behind some of the regime's worst massacres in the 1980s.

• **Africa**: More than [160 people were kidnapped](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html) from a Christian church in Nigeria, according to church leaders and police. It's another massive abduction in a country that's struggled with kidnapping epidemics for years.

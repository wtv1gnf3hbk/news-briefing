Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The Trump administration's immigration crackdown is hitting hard in Minneapolis, where children are experiencing what our team calls a "[winter of fear](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/minneapolis-children-ice-schools.html)" as ICE operations tear through their communities. Kids are having nightmares, friends are disappearing from school, and the psychological toll is mounting. This comes as Trump's border czar announced plans to [pull 700](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/04/us/trump-news) immigration agents from Minnesota, part of a broader reshuffling that's left local police chiefs struggling to maintain community trust they've spent years building.

The broader political picture shows Trump continuing to push boundaries on federal power. He's [repeating calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/trump-save-act-elections.html) to "nationalize" elections, even as his own White House walks back the comments, and his administration has thrown [Harvard deal talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/trump-changing-course-throws-harvard-deal-talks-into-chaos.html) into chaos with another policy reversal. It's a pattern that historians are calling "neoroyalism," reflecting how Trump's governing style echoes monarchical approaches to executive power.

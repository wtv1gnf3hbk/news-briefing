Trump's backing down on one of his more audacious demands. He's [dropped his push](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-payment.html) for Harvard to pay the federal government after meeting stiff resistance from the university and legal experts who questioned his authority to extract such payments. The move comes as Trump faces broader pushback on multiple fronts, with hard-line Republicans now objecting to a deal that would end the partial government shutdown.

The BBC reports that British authorities are reviewing misconduct claims after files suggest former EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson shared government information with Epstein.

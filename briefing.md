Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Bangladesh has wrapped up its first free election since protesters toppled the authoritarian Sheikh Hasina in 2024, and the results are reshaping the country's political landscape. The [Bangladesh Nationalist Party](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/12/world/bangladesh-election-results) secured a commanding two-thirds majority with 204 of 300 parliamentary seats, though the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party is expressing dissatisfaction with the vote count, according to Al Jazeera. It's a pivotal moment for a nation that endured 15 years of increasingly despotic rule.

Meanwhile, European leaders are bracing for what could be a tense transatlantic reckoning at the [Munich Security Conference](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/13/world/munich-security-conference), where Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to deliver his first major address to European allies. The BBC reports that Rubio has already warned of a "new era in geopolitics," setting the stage for what many see as a crucial test of NATO unity after Trump's recent threats to annex Greenland. The timing couldn't be more fraught, with European officials openly nervous about America's commitment to traditional alliance structures.

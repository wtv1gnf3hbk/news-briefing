Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The domestic political picture is sharpening as Republicans push through [new voting restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/us/politics/republicans-vote-fraud-id-midterms.html) in Congress, seemingly preparing for potential losses in upcoming elections. The moves include stricter voter ID requirements and other measures that echo familiar debates about election security versus access. It's part of a broader pattern we're seeing play out in state redistricting battles, where the [usual gerrymandering](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/18/us/midterm-elections-congress-gerrymander-maps.html) is happening but with higher stakes than usual.

Meanwhile, Trump is doubling down on his unconventional diplomatic approach, with [key advisers](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/17/us/politics/trump-witkoff-kushner-diplomacy.html) like Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner taking leading roles in foreign policy despite the administration's struggles to fill traditional diplomatic posts. Speaking of diplomacy, the Russia-Ukraine [peace talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/18/world/europe/russia-ukraine-us-talks-war.html) in Geneva wrapped up their second day after just two hours, with little sign of progress. Al Jazeera reports that Zelenskyy accused Russia of stalling, which isn't exactly surprising but underscores how difficult any resolution remains.

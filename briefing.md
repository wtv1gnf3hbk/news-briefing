Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The U.S. is facing twin crises that are testing the Trump administration just over a week into its second term. In Minneapolis, tensions are boiling over after [Representative Ilhan Omar](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/ilhan-omar-town-hall-minnesota.html) was attacked at a town hall, while federal immigration enforcement has sparked deadly confrontations. The situation has gotten so heated that Trump officials are now suggesting federal agents may have [deviated from protocol](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html) in the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is facing mounting calls for her removal after her handling of the crisis.

Meanwhile, the confrontation with Iran is escalating rapidly. Trump has threatened Tehran with a ["massive armada"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html) and warned that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal, according to the BBC. Iran's response has been defiant, with officials saying they'll "respond like never before" to American threats. This isn't just saber-rattling anymore. U.S. naval forces are actively moving toward the Gulf, and both sides seem to be positioning for a potential military confrontation that could reshape the Middle East.

**Business/Tech**

• [Amazon's cutting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html) 16,000 corporate jobs in its latest round of layoffs, while also shuttering most of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores in the coming days. The dual moves signal how even tech giants are retrenching in uncertain times.

• Microsoft's facing a classic AI-era contradiction: the company [pledged to conserve](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html) water, but now expects its usage to soar as artificial intelligence demands massive data center cooling systems.

• The EU is pushing for a [digital euro](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNeFZvdDlSQm94U0twN09fenFGcVZMeFRjLUJlalNQa0haYjV6bC13Z2RsQ3hUNHIzenZTRUFYdVBOVmREYzRUeU9GU25pTzBHdUR3UF9FYm5PVXRTeC14enBDUy1YbkRCTHJhLW1wY1RIal82YTIyT3NNdjJsc2prQnptdUhBNEJMUVJIRUM1SUlBVklIMXhfVjBTaHE1WWFUdWxTRldzX3ZmSkZIbU1qMnE0dU5ob19h?oc=5) to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar, Reuters reports. It's part of a broader European strategy to build financial independence from American systems.

• [Snap's doubling down](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQdWlXMHluSDJOQmNRSmxKdVhxMFI0SWlpVFpFb2U0bzM4Y2hhWEVyM2dOU1lWRGVnQlA2dXhhNHEtcUJaNVFPXzdxZ1JueG5CdzdWRWphWjVTNmVEQXh3anRheWlTNVBHbndCTFVoMjhoeUxobTBRbXhYQ1hQZ2phNm5INFRtNUo1M09WVW84WXpkSUU4Y3NhZVZ4S0pHUk9LLXhB?oc=5) on smart glasses by creating a new independent unit, betting that wearable tech will be the next big platform shift beyond smartphones.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Trinidadian families have filed a [wrongful death lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html) against the U.S. military after a boat strike incident. It's raising questions about American military operations in Caribbean waters and accountability for civilian casualties.

• **Europe**: A Russian strike killed five people on a Ukrainian train, but the [train kept running](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html) after shedding its burned cars. It's a stark example of how Ukraine's infrastructure has adapted to constant attacks, with resilience becoming part of daily operations.

• **Asia**: The Taliban is holding a [U.S. citizen](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html) in Kabul, according to witnesses, adding another complication to America's already fraught relationship with Afghanistan's rulers. The case highlights how Americans abroad remain vulnerable even years after the U.S. withdrawal.

• **Middle East**: Trump's getting sweeping new powers over Gaza through something called the [Board of Peace](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/middleeast/board-of-peace-trump-gaza.html), which could fundamentally reshape American involvement in Palestinian territories and potentially sideline traditional diplomatic channels.

• **Africa**: South Africa is facing [new U.S. scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html) after conducting naval drills with Iran. The exercises couldn't have come at a worse time, given Trump's escalating confrontation with Tehran, and they're testing Pretoria's historically non-aligned foreign policy.

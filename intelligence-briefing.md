**OPENER**
Good morning. A UAE firm quietly took a stake in the Trump family's crypto company, creating new foreign investment concerns for the presidency.

**THE LEAD**
The New York Times reports that a United Arab Emirates company acquired an undisclosed stake in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture. This marks direct foreign investment in a business owned by the sitting president's family. The UAE connection adds complexity to US-Middle East relations as Trump navigates regional tensions, particularly around Iran policy where Emirati and American interests don't always align.

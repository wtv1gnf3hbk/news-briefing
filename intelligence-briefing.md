**Good morning.** A UAE firm quietly bought a stake in the Trump family's crypto company, creating new questions about foreign money and presidential business interests.

**THE LEAD**

The New York Times reports that [a UAE firm took a stake](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html) in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture. This puts Middle Eastern money directly into a business run by the president's family while he sets policy toward the region. The investment happened quietly, without public disclosure of the terms or timing. This is exactly the kind of foreign financial entanglement that ethics experts have warned about since Trump took office.

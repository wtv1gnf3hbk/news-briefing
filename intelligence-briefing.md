**Good morning.** The UAE quietly bought a stake in the Trump family's crypto company World Liberty Financial, creating new conflicts of interest for a sitting president.

**THE LEAD**

[CIC Digital](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html), a UAE state-backed firm, purchased tokens worth millions in World Liberty Financial. The deal happened after Trump took office, meaning foreign government money is now flowing directly to the Trump family business. This violates basic ethics rules that presidents should avoid financial entanglements with foreign powers. The UAE is already pushing Trump on Iran sanctions and Gaza policy - now they have direct financial leverage over his family's wealth.

**Good morning.** A UAE firm quietly took a stake in the Trump family's crypto company World Liberty Financial.

**THE LEAD**

The New York Times reports that a United Arab Emirates company acquired an undisclosed stake in World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency venture run by Trump's sons. This creates potential conflicts of interest as Trump conducts foreign policy with a Middle Eastern ally while his family business has financial ties to UAE investors. The investment occurred while Trump was president-elect, according to the reporting, giving foreign actors direct financial relationships with the incoming administration's business interests.

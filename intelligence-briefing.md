Good morning. A UAE firm quietly took a stake in the Trump family's crypto company World Liberty Financial, creating new conflicts of interest at the highest levels of government.

**THE LEAD**

The [UAE investment](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html) in World Liberty Financial puts foreign money directly into Trump family business while the president shapes Middle East policy. This goes beyond typical ethics concerns about presidential business dealings - it creates a direct financial link between Trump family profits and a key Gulf ally's interests. The investment size and timing remain unclear, but it marks another erosion of traditional boundaries between presidential duties and personal wealth.

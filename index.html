<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Iran's back to business at its nuclear and missile facilities, according to new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/world/middleeast/iran-missile-nuclear-repairs.html" target="_blank">satellite imagery</a> that shows Tehran rebuilding sites damaged in recent Israeli strikes. This comes as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/6/us-iran-talks-live-critical-negotiations-set-to-begin-in-oman" target="_blank">indirect talks</a> between the U.S. and Iran in Oman have ended "for now," leaving the nuclear standoff unresolved.

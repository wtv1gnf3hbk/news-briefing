<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump's immigration enforcement is running into significant legal headwinds as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/habeas-corpus-detainee-immigrant-trump-federal-courts.html" target="_blank">federal courts</a> push back against his mass deportation campaign. Judges are increasingly granting habeas corpus petitions and blocking detention orders, creating a familiar dynamic from his first term where the judiciary serves as a check on executive immigration power. The legal resistance appears to be broader this time, with courts scrutinizing both the procedures and scope of ICE operations.</p><p>The political fallout is already reshaping Washington calculations. Trump has reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/us/politics/trump-schumer-deal.html" target="_blank">reached out</a> to Chuck Schumer about cutting some kind of immigration deal, suggesting the administration recognizes it needs legislative cover for its enforcement agenda. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/us-mayors-minnesota-ice-trump.html" target="_blank">mayors across the country</a> are grappling with how to balance public safety concerns against community trust as ICE operations ramp up in their cities.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Wall Street's getting bearish on America itself. Traders are now betting against the dollar and U.S. assets in what analysts are calling a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/business/sell-america-dollar-financial-markets.html" target="_blank">"Sell America"</a> strategy, reflecting concerns about Trump's trade and fiscal policies.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html" target="_blank">OpenAI's hunting</a> for up to $100 billion in new funding, which would make it one of the most valuable private companies ever. The AI arms race is getting expensive fast.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-01/opec-on-track-to-rafity-output-pause-in-march-delegates-say" target="_blank">OPEC's preparing</a> to pause production increases in March, according to Bloomberg, as the cartel tries to prop up oil prices.</p><p>• The AI boom is about to hit your wallet in unexpected ways. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/ai-memory-chips-pc-smartphone.html" target="_blank">Memory chip shortages</a> driven by data center demand could push up prices for your next PC or smartphone.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Costa Rica's heading for a potentially dramatic political shift as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/americas/costa-rica-election.html" target="_blank">right-wing populist</a> holds a commanding lead ahead of Sunday's election. It's another sign of the populist wave reshaping Latin American politics, even in traditionally stable democracies.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Ukraine peace talks have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-us-peace-talks.html" target="_blank">pushed back</a> after the U.S. and Russia held their own bilateral meetings first. The delay suggests the diplomatic choreography is more complex than initially hoped, with each side trying to establish favorable conditions.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Indonesia has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html" target="_blank">lifted its ban</a> on X's Grok AI chatbot after getting new assurances from the company. It's a reminder of how AI governance is playing out differently across countries as governments scramble to regulate the technology.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/world/middleeast/gaza-medical-evacuation-rafah-crossing.html" target="_blank">Rafah crossing</a> is finally reopening on a trial basis, offering hope for medical evacuations from Gaza. But the restrictions on who can return remain murky, creating uncertainty for Gazans currently outside the territory.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/africa/mozambique-south-africa-flood.html" target="_blank">Devastating floods</a> have displaced hundreds of thousands across southern Africa, with Mozambique and South Africa bearing the brunt. It's the latest reminder of how climate change is hitting the continent's most vulnerable populations hardest.</p>

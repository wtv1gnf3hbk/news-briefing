<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Minneapolis crisis is rippling far beyond Minnesota's borders, creating a defining test for Trump's immigration crackdown. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html" target="_blank">State legislators</a> across the country are moving to restrict ICE operations in their states as violent clashes continue in the Twin Cities following the shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents. What started as an immigration enforcement operation has mushroomed into a full-blown political crisis that's forcing Trump to recalibrate his approach.</p><p>The administration's struggling to contain the fallout, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html" target="_blank">Stephen Miller</a> now suggesting federal agents may have deviated from protocol in the shooting. That's a significant admission from one of Trump's hardline immigration architects. Meanwhile, Homeland Security Kristi Noem briefly found herself in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/noem-trump-minnesota-shooting-fallout.html" target="_blank">Trump's penalty box</a> over her handling of the crisis, though she's apparently back in favor. The whole mess has exposed deep tensions within the administration about how aggressively to pursue deportations when local resistance is this fierce.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">Amazon's cutting</a> another 16,000 corporate jobs in what's becoming a steady drumbeat of tech layoffs. The cuts hit everything from AWS to retail operations as the company tries to streamline ahead of what many expect to be a tougher economic year.</p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/economy/fed-trump-powell-interest-rates.html" target="_blank">Fed meets</a> today at what might be the most politically charged moment for the central bank in years. Trump's been ramping up pressure on Powell, and the independence question is front and center as markets wait for rate guidance.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's water</a> consumption is set to explode despite previous conservation pledges, all thanks to AI data centers that need massive cooling systems. It's a perfect example of how the AI boom is creating unexpected environmental costs.</p><p>• <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQdWlXMHluSDJOQmNRSmxKdVhxMFI0SWlpVFpFb2U0bzM4Y2hhWEVyM2dOU1lWRGVnQlA2dXhhNHEtcUJaNVFPXzdxZ1JueG5CdzdWRWphWjVTNmVEQXh3anRheWlTNVBHbndCTFV" target="_blank">Snap's looking</a> for investors to fund its new smart glasses division as it tries to take on Meta in the AR space, according to Reuters.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html" target="_blank">Trinidadian families</a> have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the U.S. military after a boat strike incident. The case could complicate U.S. naval operations in Caribbean waters where Washington's been trying to counter drug trafficking. Also, <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV85cUxQdllRUlNNbS1ZT3pVX3FTVnYwTmlNbjU1Q2FtcV9zbWowTUpRd1ZJRWoxb0YyZVpLVnNraFBLTFFsZXdyMWlOSXM3U0h0RG5IaXRTTTFPUmhsbE9KTEtnZ2tLWldFVDQ0S19QZmU" target="_blank">Venezuelan progress</a> is looking "good and decent" since the U.S. ousted Maduro, Rubio told senators.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">Russian drone</a> strike killed five people on a Ukrainian passenger train, showing how Moscow's targeting civilian infrastructure. Putin's also doing some interesting diplomatic juggling, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/russia-putin-syria-al-sharaa-meeting.html" target="_blank">welcoming Syria's</a> new leader to Moscow while still harboring Assad. It's classic Putin hedging his bets.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: The Taliban are apparently holding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html" target="_blank">a U.S. citizen</a> in Kabul, according to witnesses, which could complicate whatever minimal engagement the Trump administration has with Afghanistan's rulers. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/korea-first-lady-kim-keon-hee-jail.html" target="_blank">South Korea's</a> former first lady Kim Keon Hee is facing possible jail time in a major corruption case.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Iraq's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/middleeast/trump-iraq-prime-minister-al-maliki.html" target="_blank">prime minister nominee</a> is pushing back hard against Trump's threats, which could signal a rockier relationship between Baghdad and Washington than expected. Trump's also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/trump-news/trump-threatens-iran-again-and-calls-for-negotiations-on-a-nuclear-deal" target="_blank">ramping up</a> pressure on Iran again, calling for nuclear negotiations while building up military forces in the Gulf.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">South Africa's</a> facing fresh U.S. scrutiny after conducting naval exercises with Iran. It's exactly the kind of issue that could test the new administration's approach to countries that won't pick sides in great power competition.</p>

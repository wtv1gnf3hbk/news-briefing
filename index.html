<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump isn't backing down on tariffs. After the Supreme Court struck down his initial global tariffs, he's now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">raising them</a> to 15 percent on all imports. The move shows he's determined to push forward with his trade agenda despite facing legal challenges and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html" target="_blank">divided Supreme Court</a> that could complicate his broader plans.</p><p>The fallout is creating what businesses are calling "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/tariffs-supreme-court-global-busines-reaction.html" target="_blank">murky waters</a>" for global trade, while consumers are left in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/tariff-ruling-consumer-prices.html" target="_blank">waiting game</a> to see how prices will be affected. Meanwhile, Justice Gorsuch's concurrence in the Court's ruling contained what some are reading as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/gorsuch-congress-trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">subtle reproach</a> of Congress for ceding too much power to the executive branch.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Honeywell is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/honeywell-considers-walking-away-from-johnson-matthey-catalyst-deal" target="_blank">considering walking away</a> from its acquisition of Johnson Matthey's catalyst business, Bloomberg reports, though the reasons aren't clear yet.</p><p>• The AI boom is facing more skepticism than the dot-com era ever did, with public sentiment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html" target="_blank">notably cooler</a> toward the technology despite massive corporate investments.</p><p>• CLO funds are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/riskiest-clo-funds-are-flashing-a-warning-sign-credit-weekly" target="_blank">flashing warning signs</a> as fear of rising defaults spreads from leveraged loans to retail funds, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>• West Virginia is suing Apple, claiming the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/technology/apple-west-virginia-lawsuit-child-sexual-abuse.html" target="_blank">allows sharing</a> of child sexual abuse material through its platforms.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Colombia's military is struggling against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/americas/colombia-combat-drones-military.html" target="_blank">cheap combat drones</a> that cost just $600 but are proving remarkably effective against billion-dollar defense systems. Trump's new oil sanctions are also creating what officials call <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/americas/cuba-oil-blockade-trump.html" target="_blank">a new blockade</a> that's strangling Cuba's economy.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: King Charles is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/europe/andrew-epstein-queen-elizabeth-charles.html" target="_blank">pulling away</a> from Prince Andrew in a way Queen Elizabeth never did, marking a clear break from his mother's approach to the scandal-plagued royal. The BBC reports that Iranian students staged their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj2kzkrj0o" target="_blank">first anti-government protests</a> since last month's deadly crackdown.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: India is finding it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/india-russia-oil-trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">more complicated</a> to buy Russian oil after Trump's tariff changes, while the country tries to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/asia/ai-summit-india-foreign-policy.html" target="_blank">navigate between</a> the US and China at this week's AI summit.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Israeli airstrikes in eastern Lebanon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah.html" target="_blank">killed at least 10</a> Hezbollah members, officials say, while Al Jazeera reports that Iran is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/iran-demands-evidence-as-trump-un-experts-highlight-protest-killings" target="_blank">demanding evidence</a> as Trump and UN experts highlight protest killings.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: South Africa <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/arts/design/south-africa-venice-biennale.html" target="_blank">pulled out</a> of the Venice Biennale after a furor over Gaza-related artwork, while the UN found that an assault on a Sudanese city bore <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/19/world/africa/sudan-un-el-fasher-rsf.html" target="_blank">hallmarks of genocide</a>.</p>

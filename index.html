<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The big story emerging from Davos is how Canada's positioning itself as a credible alternative to American leadership just as Trump takes the stage. Finance Minister Mark Carney's pitch to global elites wasn't subtle. He's essentially arguing that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/canada/carney-speech-davos-trump.html" target="_blank">Canada can lead</a> where America won't, particularly on climate and trade stability. It's a remarkable moment for a country that usually punches below its weight diplomatically.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump's own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news" target="_blank">Davos appearance</a> is doing exactly what you'd expect. He's touting the U.S. economy while taking shots at Europe, and his Greenland ambitions are serious enough that they're actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/greenland-stocks-bonds-dollar-gold.html" target="_blank">rattling markets</a>. Investors are trying to price in scenarios that would have seemed absurd just months ago. The fact that we're even discussing congressional constraints on territorial expansion tells you everything about where we are.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Johnson & Johnson's forecasting profits above Wall Street expectations for 2026, according to Reuters, suggesting the pharma giant sees smooth sailing ahead despite regulatory uncertainties.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/metas-new-ai-team-delivered-first-key-models-internally-this-month-cto-says-2026-01-21/" target="_blank">Meta's building</a> new AI models internally through a dedicated team that delivered its first major outputs this month, Reuters reports. The CTO says they're moving fast to compete with OpenAI and others.</p><p>• Netflix is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/business/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-takeover.html" target="_blank">revamping its bid</a> for Warner Bros. Discovery, trying to outmaneuver Paramount in what's shaping up to be a massive media consolidation battle.</p><p>• The Supreme Court's hearing arguments on whether Trump can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-fed-cook.html" target="_blank">fire Fed</a> governors, a case that could fundamentally reshape central bank independence.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: The U.S. raid that apparently removed Maduro from power isn't generating the anti-American backlash you might expect. According to polling, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html" target="_blank">Latin Americans' hatred</a> of the Venezuelan dictator is so intense it's drowning out concerns about sovereignty violations.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: A French doctor has revolutionized women's pain treatment by actually listening to patients, the BBC notes. Her work at what's called the "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/france-doctor-house-of-women.html" target="_blank">House of Women</a>" is changing medical practice across France by treating conditions that were dismissed for decades.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Japan's firing up the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/japan-nuclear-restart.html" target="_blank">world's biggest</a> nuclear plant as anxiety about energy security overrides post-Fukushima caution. It's a major shift for a country that's been deeply skeptical of nuclear power for over a decade.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Israel just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/middleeast/israel-unrwa-jerusalem.html" target="_blank">seized control</a> of the UN refugee agency's Jerusalem headquarters, escalating its campaign against UNRWA in ways that directly challenge international law and UN operations.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Church leaders say over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html" target="_blank">160 people</a> were kidnapped from a Christian church in Nigeria, highlighting the country's ongoing security crisis that's now drawing U.S. military strikes.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump's second presidency is showing just how far he's willing to go to relitigate 2020. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/politics/georgia-trump-election.html" target="_blank">FBI searched</a> locations in Georgia as part of what appears to be a renewed push on his election grievances, signaling that his claims of fraud aren't just political theater but actual policy priorities with federal resources behind them. This comes as tensions are boiling over his immigration crackdown, with Democrats trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dhs-spending.html" target="_blank">rein in ICE</a> through a spending deal while the agency faces accusations of violating court orders.</p><p>The international reaction to Trump 2.0 is crystallizing around China policy. He's warning allies like Britain and Canada that deeper trade ties with Beijing are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/asia/trump-starmer-china-canada-trade.html" target="_blank">"very dangerous,"</a> just as UK Prime Minister Starmer was celebrating progress from his Beijing visit. It's a preview of how Trump plans to pressure allies into choosing sides in what he sees as a zero-sum competition with China.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html" target="_blank">OpenAI's reportedly</a> looking to raise as much as $100 billion in its next funding round. That would be a staggering valuation that shows just how much investors are betting on AI dominance.</p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/us-trade-deficit-tariffs.html" target="_blank">trade deficit</a> actually widened despite Trump's tariffs, which is going to complicate his "tariffs solve everything" narrative pretty quickly.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/business/energy-environment/chevron-exxon-mobil-earnings.html" target="_blank">Chevron's pointing</a> to Venezuela as a bright spot even as Big Oil earnings fall across the board. That's notable given the complex sanctions dance around Venezuelan oil.</p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/media/washington-post-newsroom.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> is planning major cuts to reshape its newsroom, another sign of how traditional media is struggling to find a sustainable model.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America:</strong> Venezuela's parliament just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/americas/venezuela-new-law-oil-foreign-companies.html" target="_blank">approved sweeping changes</a> to its oil sector that could reshape how foreign companies operate there. This comes as Maduro consolidates control and oil revenues become even more crucial.</p><p>• <strong>Europe:</strong> Ukraine simply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/europe/ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-huliaipole.html" target="_blank">can't defend</a> its entire front line anymore, and Russia's finding those gaps to exploit. The war's entering a more dangerous phase as Ukrainian resources get stretched thinner.</p><p>• <strong>Asia:</strong> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/business/panama-canal-ck-hutchison.html" target="_blank">Panama court</a> just struck down a Hong Kong firm's contract to operate canal ports. It's exactly the kind of Chinese infrastructure influence that Trump's been railing against.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East:</strong> Syria's new government and Kurdish forces have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/middleeast/syria-kurd-sdf-agreement.html" target="_blank">sealed a deal</a> to merge their military forces. That's a potentially huge development for stability in northeastern Syria and could reshape the entire post-Assad landscape.</p><p>• <strong>Africa:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/africa/mozambique-south-africa-flood.html" target="_blank">Devastating floods</a> have displaced hundreds of thousands across southern Africa. Mozambique and South Africa are bearing the brunt of what's shaping up to be a major humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Trump administration's already complex web of business interests just got a new international dimension. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html" target="_blank">U.A.E. firm</a> quietly took a stake in the Trump family's crypto company, World Liberty Financial, raising fresh questions about foreign influence and conflicts of interest. The investment comes as the administration navigates delicate Gulf relationships and cryptocurrency regulation, making this exactly the kind of entanglement ethics experts have been warning about.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's a major political upset brewing in Texas that could signal trouble for Republicans heading into the midterms. A Democrat just <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPeXlXVkEtcUpyaUs5ZHVSVE5MUFU3QVQwTXdDR19saGZIdmNTdFN4T0xfbWxPME93SUtDMG1vMUhjelFjYzJJbG5YNGZodXNfUmhfbkpPN2dNOS1paEh6OV90TzhRaERXSFRmdnhoRzZJY3IxVV9wN0ZucGxKS3lFdjdvUEJ2S0ZEb0xPMW50emQzdnpwazV6dkhjTF9CX2NUMExB?oc=5" target="_blank">flipped a state Senate seat</a> that Trump carried by 17 points just two years ago. That's the kind of swing that has party strategists reaching for antacids.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p>
<p>• Oracle's making a massive bet on the AI boom, planning to <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV85cUxQMTVmVjhaWDdFRFhZc3BHa0JQZHh1SFo1X1dRd2JxZzh1QWxOeXh2c19xbkJMbHZtdWNfRmRwallmSVBKdUZrdXloMkhHSFF4cUNPeUZGV25aTEJDbzNIaHNjQ1YxcUVNQzlqMVc0TlVSZUItbWJlUXJFb2NndTl1b1pjX2hJWFQ1UGYtNEliLThPSkpU?oc=5" target="_blank">raise $45-50 billion</a> this year according to Reuters. That's one of the biggest corporate fundraising efforts in recent memory and shows how desperate tech giants are to keep up in the AI arms race.</p><p>• Speaking of AI money, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html" target="_blank">OpenAI's in talks</a> to raise as much as $100 billion, which would make it one of the most valuable private companies on the planet.</p><p>• Wall Street traders are embracing a new mantra: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/business/sell-america-dollar-financial-markets.html" target="_blank">"Sell America."</a> The dollar's looking vulnerable as investors worry about Trump's economic policies and their impact on global markets.</p><p>• India just threw markets a curveball with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/india-s-budget-disappoints-with-surprise-tax-hike-investors-say" target="_blank">surprise tax hikes</a> on equity derivatives trading, according to Bloomberg. Investors are calling it a major disappointment that could pressure domestic shares.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Costa Rica's about to get its own taste of the global populist wave. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/americas/costa-rica-election.html" target="_blank">right-wing populist candidate</a> is leading ahead of the country's election, which could shift the political dynamics in this traditionally stable Central American democracy.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Russia's escalating its energy warfare against Ukraine, with strikes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/europe/russia-strikes-ukraine-energy-sector-killing-12-miners.html" target="_blank">killing 12 miners</a> and targeting critical infrastructure. It's part of Moscow's strategy to freeze Ukraine into submission as winter drags on.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Indonesia just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html" target="_blank">lifted its ban</a> on Grok after getting new assurances from X Corp.

The rhetoric comes as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/31/world/middleeast/iran-explosions-jitters.html" target="_blank">explosions spread jitters</a> across the country and Tehran braces for potential foreign strikes.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Egypt's been running a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html" target="_blank">secret air base</a> that's fueling Sudan's devastating drone war. The revelation shows how regional powers are quietly taking sides in Africa's forgotten conflicts, making peace even more elusive.</p>

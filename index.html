<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The big story this morning is Trump's dramatic escalation in his push to reshape American elections. The president is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-nationalize-elections.html" target="_blank">calling for Republicans</a> to "nationalize" elections, marking his most aggressive move yet to centralize control over voting systems. This comes as he's simultaneously pressuring House holdouts on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/02/us/trump-news" target="_blank">spending deal</a> that's gaining momentum but still faces resistance from fiscal conservatives.</p><p>The Epstein files continue to reverberate on both sides of the Atlantic. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/bill-hillary-clinton-epstein-comer-contempt.html" target="_blank">Clintons have agreed</a> to testify in the House Epstein inquiry after initially resisting, while across the pond, the BBC reports that British authorities are reviewing misconduct claims after files suggest Peter Mandelson sent government information to Epstein. It's a reminder of how these revelations are creating political headaches far beyond U.S. borders.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Elon Musk is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html" target="_blank">merging SpaceX</a> with his AI startup xAI, creating a potentially massive integrated space and artificial intelligence company that could reshape both industries.</p><p>• Waymo just raised a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/waymo-funding-growth.html" target="_blank">staggering $16 billion</a> to fuel its global ambitions in autonomous driving, signaling serious investor confidence in the self-driving car race.</p><p>• China's rolling out its vision for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/china-ai-regulations.html" target="_blank">AI dominance</a> with a "move fast but obey the rules" approach that tries to balance innovation with state control.</p><p>• Bloomberg reports that China's brutal <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/china-s-delivery-price-war-starts-to-cool-as-brands-raise-prices" target="_blank">delivery price war</a> is finally cooling as major brands like KFC start raising prices after years of unsustainable discounting.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Colombia's President Petro just can't help himself when it comes to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/americas/colombia-petro-trump-white-house.html" target="_blank">needling Trump</a>, continuing his provocative rhetoric even days before their scheduled White House meeting.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: After months of political chaos, France's Prime Minister finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/europe/france-budget-lecornu.html" target="_blank">cleared a major hurdle</a> to pass a budget, offering some stability to the country's shaky coalition government.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Trump announced a significant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-tariffs-india-trade-deal.html" target="_blank">trade deal with India</a> that will reduce tariffs, reportedly in exchange for New Delhi agreeing to scale back Russian oil purchases.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: U.S. and Iranian officials are set to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-meeting-trump-threats.html" target="_blank">meet directly</a> as both sides try to navigate diplomatic openings despite Trump's continued threats, while the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/middleeast/gaza-rafah-border-crossing.html" target="_blank">Rafah crossing</a> between Gaza and Egypt has reopened in a positive step for the fragile cease-fire.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A new investigation reveals Egypt's been running <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html" target="_blank">a secret air base</a> that's fueling Sudan's devastating drone war, adding another layer to the complex regional proxy conflict.</p>

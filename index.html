<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Minneapolis immigration crisis is reshaping the political landscape in ways that extend far beyond Minnesota. What started with the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents has now triggered a wave of state-level resistance to ICE operations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html" target="_blank">Legislators are moving</a> to restrict immigration enforcement in their states, creating a potential patchwork of sanctuary policies that could complicate Trump's deportation agenda nationwide.</p><p>The fallout continues to reverberate through the Trump administration itself. Stephen Miller is now suggesting that federal agents may have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html" target="_blank">deviated from protocol</a> in the Pretti shooting, while the crisis briefly put Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/noem-trump-minnesota-shooting-fallout.html" target="_blank">Trump's penalty box</a>. The chaos has also elevated familiar Trump operative Corey Lewandowski, who's emerged as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-noem-trump.html" target="_blank">a central figure</a> in the administration's damage control efforts.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Amazon is cutting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">16,000 corporate jobs</a> in its latest round of layoffs, signaling continued tech sector consolidation as companies adjust to post-pandemic realities.</p><p>• The Federal Reserve's meeting today comes at a particularly delicate moment, with Trump's public criticism putting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/economy/fed-trump-powell-interest-rates.html" target="_blank">central bank independence</a> squarely in the spotlight.</p><p>• Microsoft's AI ambitions are creating an uncomfortable contradiction with its climate pledges, as the company now expects its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">water usage</a> to soar thanks to thirsty data centers.</p><p>• The Sundance Film Festival is saying goodbye to Park City after decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/media/sundance-film-festival-park-city-boulder.html" target="_blank">relocating to Boulder</a> in a move that reflects changing economics in the film industry.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Trinidadian families are taking the U.S. military to court over a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html" target="_blank">boat strike</a> that killed several people, raising questions about American naval operations in Caribbean waters.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: A Russian missile strike that killed five people couldn't stop a Ukrainian train from continuing its route after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">shedding burned cars</a>. It's a small but telling symbol of Ukrainian resilience as the war grinds on.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: An American citizen has gone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html" target="_blank">missing in Kabul</a>, with witnesses saying the Taliban is holding him. The case highlights the ongoing dangers for Americans in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Trump received intelligence briefings suggesting that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/trump-reports-iran-government.html" target="_blank">Iran's government</a> is weaker than previously thought, potentially influencing his increasingly aggressive stance toward Tehran.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: South Africa is facing fresh scrutiny from Washington after conducting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">naval exercises</a> with Iran. The drills are testing Pretoria's attempt to maintain non-alignment in an increasingly polarized world.</p>

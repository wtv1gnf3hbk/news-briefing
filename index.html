<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump's escalating his battle over election administration, now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-nationalize-elections.html" target="_blank">calling for Republicans</a> to "nationalize" elections. It's a striking rhetorical shift that signals he's moving beyond his usual complaints about state-level voting rules toward something that sounds more like federal intervention. This comes as he's also scheduled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/colombia-petro-trump-meeting.html" target="_blank">meet today</a> with Colombia's President Petro at the White House, presumably to smooth over their recent deportation flight standoff.</p><p>The international picture shows similar tensions around governance and control. The BBC's leading with revelations that Peter Mandelson allegedly shared government information with Jeffrey Epstein, while Al Jazeera's focused on Israel restricting medical evacuations from Gaza despite the ceasefire. It's a day when questions about who controls what are front and center globally.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Elon Musk's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html" target="_blank">merging SpaceX</a> with his AI startup xAI, creating what could be a formidable space-meets-artificial-intelligence conglomerate that'll have serious implications for both industries.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/waymo-funding-growth.html" target="_blank">Waymo raised</a> a massive $16 billion to fuel its global expansion plans, signaling that investors still believe autonomous vehicles are the next big thing despite years of slower-than-expected progress.</p><p>• Trump and India <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/us-india-trade-tariffs.html" target="_blank">called off</a> their trade war with a new deal to reduce tariffs, though the exact terms remain frustratingly vague for businesses trying to plan their supply chains.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/energy-environment/siemens-energy-ai-power-demand.html" target="_blank">Siemens Energy's betting</a> $1 billion that AI's power demands will keep growing, a major infrastructure play on the assumption that data centers aren't going anywhere.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's showing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/americas/venezuela-rodriguez-maduro-authoritarian.html" target="_blank">some signs</a> of easing its authoritarian grip, but analysts are skeptical about how long any opening might last given Maduro's track record.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/denmark-trump-boycott.html" target="_blank">Greenland crisis</a> has Danes responding with their characteristic dry humor, even as the diplomatic implications of Trump's territorial ambitions continue to reverberate across NATO.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Xi Jinping's military purge continues with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/02/03/world/asia/china-xi-military-purge.html" target="_blank">more generals disappearing</a> from public view, part of what appears to be the most extensive cleanup of China's armed forces in decades.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/middleeast/palestinians-gaza-return.html" target="_blank">Palestinians are returning</a> to Gaza for the first time in nearly two years, though the ceasefire remains fragile and medical evacuations are still severely restricted.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: New reporting reveals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html" target="_blank">Egypt's been running</a> a secret air base that's central to Sudan's drone war, showing how regional powers are quietly fueling the conflict.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The intersection of domestic politics and international tensions is getting messy fast. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/ilhan-omar-town-hall-minnesota.html" target="_blank">Representative Ilhan Omar</a> was physically attacked at a Minneapolis town hall yesterday, escalating what's already become a volatile situation around immigration enforcement. The incident comes as the Trump administration faces growing scrutiny over its handling of Minneapolis tensions, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html" target="_blank">Stephen Miller suggesting</a> federal agents may have deviated from protocol in a recent shooting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump's saber-rattling with Iran is reaching a crescendo. The president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html" target="_blank">threatened Iran</a> with a "massive armada" while pressing a new set of demands, and Tehran isn't backing down. Iran's leaders say they'll "respond like never before" to Trump's threats, according to Al Jazeera, with military officials claiming they're ready "with their fingers on the trigger." It's the kind of escalatory rhetoric that makes diplomats nervous, especially as the U.S. builds up military assets in the Gulf.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/business/federal-reserve-interest-rates" target="_blank">Federal Reserve held</a> rates steady as expected, but markets are still jittery about what comes next. Treasury Secretary Bessent tried to shore up confidence by touting a strong dollar policy, according to Bloomberg, though Trump's own comments have been sending mixed signals.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">Amazon's cutting</a> another 16,000 jobs in its latest round of corporate layoffs, signaling the tech giant's belt-tightening continues. The company's also reportedly closing most of its Amazon Go and Fresh stores within days, per AP reports.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's water usage</a> is expected to soar in the AI era, despite previous pledges to conserve. It's a reminder that the AI boom comes with real environmental costs that companies are still figuring out how to manage.</p><p>• <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQdWlXMHluSDJOQmNRSmxKdVhxMFI0SWlpVFpFb2U0bzM4Y2hhWEVyM2dOU1lWRGVnQlA2dXhhNHEtcUJaNVFPXzdxZ1JueG5CdzdWRWphWjVTNmVEQXh3anRheWlTNVBHbndCTFVoMjhoeUxobTBRbXhYQ1hQZ2phNm5INFRtNUo1M09WVW84WXpkSUU4Y3NhZVZ4S0pHUk9LLXhB?oc=5" target="_blank">Snap's doubling down</a> on smart glasses with a new independent unit, Reuters reports, betting that wearable tech will be the next big platform shift.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html" target="_blank">Trinidadian families</a> are filing wrongful death lawsuits after a U.S. military boat strike, highlighting how American operations in the Caribbean can have tragic consequences for local communities.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">Ukraine's railways</a> are adapting to war in grimly practical ways. After a Russian strike killed five passengers, train crews simply shed the burned cars and carried on, a testament to how normalized warfare has become.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html" target="_blank">A U.S. citizen</a> has gone missing in Kabul, with witnesses saying the Taliban is holding him. It's another reminder of the precarious situation for Americans still in Afghanistan.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Trump's getting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/middleeast/board-of-peace-trump-gaza.html" target="_blank">sweeping new powers</a> over Gaza through something called the "Board of Peace." The details are murky, but it suggests the administration wants direct control over reconstruction efforts.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">South Africa's facing</a> fresh U.S. scrutiny after conducting naval drills with Iran. It's exactly the kind of partnership that puts countries in Trump's crosshairs these days.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The White House is scrambling to distance Trump from the administration's initial response to a fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, as the political fallout intensifies. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/26/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice" target="_blank">shooting has sparked</a> widespread protests and put Democrats in the unusual position of embracing a potential government shutdown fight they'd normally want to avoid. What started as an immigration enforcement operation has morphed into a broader crisis of confidence for ICE and Border Patrol, with some federal agents now expected to leave the city.</p><p>The domestic political drama comes as the U.S. faces mounting international tensions. American warships are moving closer to Iranian waters, prompting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/us-warships-gulf-waters-iran-retaliation-threats.html" target="_blank">Tehran and its allies</a> to ramp up retaliation threats. It's a familiar escalation cycle, but one that's playing out as Trump's foreign policy team is still getting its bearings. Meanwhile, a massive winter storm is wreaking havoc across multiple states, disrupting air travel and leaving thousands without power.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Silicon Valley's having its own reckoning over the Minneapolis shootings, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/technology/ice-minnesota-protests-tech.html" target="_blank">tech workers seething</a> even as their bosses continue courting Trump. The tension between corporate strategy and employee sentiment is getting harder to manage.</p><p>• The EU is opening an inquiry into Elon Musk's X over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/european-union-x-grok-ai-images-musk.html" target="_blank">sexualized A.I. images</a> generated by the platform's Grok chatbot. It's another regulatory headache for Musk's already embattled social media platform.</p><p>• Gold just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/gold-extends-gains-above-5-000-as-debasement-trade-gathers-pace" target="_blank">hit $5,000</a> an ounce for the second day running, according to Bloomberg. The so-called "debasement trade" is gathering steam as investors flee sovereign bonds and currencies.</p><p>• Asian markets are dipping after Trump threatened <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-26/asian-stocks-to-drift-higher-yen-gains-on-dollar-markets-wrap" target="_blank">new tariffs</a> on South Korean goods, Bloomberg reports. Just when investors thought they had a handle on Trump's trade policy, he's keeping them guessing.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's opening up its economy but keeping everything else locked down tight. The country is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-economy-rodriguez.html" target="_blank">freeing markets</a> while maintaining its iron grip on political dissent, creating a strange hybrid model that's worth watching.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: NATO's secretary-general delivered some harsh truths, telling Europeans they're <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/europe/nato-chief-europe-greenland-trump-us.html" target="_blank">"dreaming" if they think</a> they can defend themselves without American help. It's a blunt assessment that cuts right to the heart of transatlantic security debates.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Japan's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/japan-pandas-china.html" target="_blank">panda fans</a> are saying goodbye to their beloved furry diplomats as the animals head back to China. It sounds cute, but panda diplomacy is serious business in East Asian relations.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Israel says it's recovered the remains of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/gaza-hostage-returned-israel.html" target="_blank">last captive</a> in Gaza, potentially closing a painful chapter. The country also announced it will reopen the crucial Gaza-Egypt border crossing within days.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A South African court ruled that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela memorabilia</a> can proceed to auction, settling a dispute that had cultural and financial implications for the anti-apartheid icon's legacy.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The big story from Davos is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/business/davos-trump-xi-china.html" target="_blank">China's ascent</a> as the dominant economic power while Trump steps back from global leadership. It's a striking reversal from the usual American-led world order, and it's playing out on the biggest stage in international business. Meanwhile, Trump's hosting a "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/22/us/trump-davos-news" target="_blank">Board of Peace</a>" signing ceremony, though the details of what that actually means remain fuzzy.</p><p>The transatlantic relationship is getting even messier. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/trump-rift-europe.html" target="_blank">Trump's rift</a> with Europe is now impossible to ignore, and European leaders are scrambling to figure out their next moves. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-greenland-threats-diplomacy-force.html" target="_blank">Greenland situation</a> has NATO allies particularly worried as Trump pushes his sovereignty framework. And there's movement on Ukraine, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/us/politics/zelensky-trump-davos-ukraine-peace-deal.html" target="_blank">Zelensky meeting Trump</a> to discuss a potential peace deal.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/business/japan-nuclear-offline.html" target="_blank">Japan's nuclear</a> restart hit a snag when a malfunction forced them to take a recently restarted plant offline again. It's another setback for the country's post-Fukushima nuclear revival plans.</p><p>• Job applicants are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/ai-hiring-tools-lawsuit-eightfold-fcra.html" target="_blank">suing companies</a> to crack open the "black box" of AI hiring decisions. The lawsuit against Eightfold could set important precedents for algorithmic transparency in recruitment.</p><p>• Turkey's central bank surprised markets by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/turkey-lowers-key-interest-rate-to-37-in-fifth-straight-cut" target="_blank">cutting rates</a> less aggressively than expected, according to Bloomberg. The smaller cut to 37% suggests they might be getting more cautious about their easing cycle.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/snap-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">Snap settled</a> a major social media addiction lawsuit just before what would have been a landmark trial. The terms weren't disclosed, but it avoids what could have been a precedent-setting case.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Most Latin Americans actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html" target="_blank">supported Trump's raid</a> in Venezuela, according to new polling. It's a fascinating glimpse into how the region views both Maduro and American intervention.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Trump's sending his envoys <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/putin-meeting-witkoff-kushner-moscow-us-russia.html" target="_blank">Witkoff and Kushner</a> to meet with Putin for Ukraine talks. It's the first high-level U.S.-Russia diplomatic contact since Trump took office.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: A Filipino journalist just got <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/asia/philippines-cumpio-journalist-prison.html" target="_blank">prison time</a> in what press freedom groups are calling a direct attack on independent media. The Duterte-era crackdown on journalism continues under Marcos Jr.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Rifaat al-Assad, known as the "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/middleeast/rifaat-al-assad-dead.html" target="_blank">Butcher of Hama</a>," died at 88. The uncle of ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was behind some of the regime's worst massacres in the 1980s.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html" target="_blank">160 people were kidnapped</a> from a Christian church in Nigeria, according to church leaders and police. It's another massive abduction in a country that's struggled with kidnapping epidemics for years.</p>

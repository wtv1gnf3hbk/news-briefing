<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Minneapolis shooting crisis is reshaping American politics in real time. What started as an immigration enforcement operation has become a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-reaction.html" target="_blank">national flashpoint</a> that's forcing uncomfortable questions about federal power and conservative identity. Trump's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/27/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota" target="_blank">leadership shakeup</a> of his immigration crackdown suggests even his administration recognizes this isn't playing out as planned.</p><p>The economic backdrop isn't helping anyone's mood. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/business/economy/government-debt-bonds.html" target="_blank">Record debt levels</a> across wealthy nations are starting to worry markets about global growth prospects, while the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/business/economy/fed-rate-decision-outlook.html" target="_blank">Fed signals</a> it's in no rush to cut rates further. Meanwhile, Trump's heading to Iowa to tout economic wins, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trump-iowa-farms-tariffs.html" target="_blank">many residents</a> are feeling the squeeze from his trade policies.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• The AI hype machine might be hitting a wall. A prominent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/technology/an-ai-pioneer-warns-the-tech-herd-is-marching-into-a-dead-end.html" target="_blank">tech pioneer warns</a> that Silicon Valley's current approach is heading toward a dead end, even as everyone doubles down on the technology.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/tesla-s-price-target-is-rising-even-as-its-profit-outlook-tanks" target="_blank">Tesla's stock targets</a> keep rising on Wall Street despite analysts growing more pessimistic about the company's actual earnings potential this year. Classic disconnect between hype and fundamentals, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/germany-tests-demand-for-new-20-year-bond-in-sale-via-banks" target="_blank">Germany sold</a> €6.5 billion in new 20-year bonds with near-record demand, suggesting investors are still hunting for safe havens despite all the debt concerns.</p><p>• The EU is investigating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/european-union-x-grok-ai-images-musk.html" target="_blank">Musk's X platform</a> over its AI tool creating sexualized images, adding another regulatory headache for the social media company.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's government is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-economy-rodriguez.html" target="_blank">liberalizing its economy</a> while keeping everything else locked down tight. It's a fascinating experiment in selective authoritarianism that's actually showing some economic results.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Britain's trying to thread an impossible needle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/europe/uk-china-visit-starmer-trade.html" target="_blank">seeking closer trade</a> ties with China without triggering Trump's wrath. The balancing act reflects how much the geopolitical landscape has shifted in just a week.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Trump's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/asia/korea-trump-higher-tariff.html" target="_blank">threatening higher tariffs</a> on South Korea just months after they struck a trade deal, leaving Seoul scrambling to figure out what happened to their carefully negotiated agreement.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/us-warships-gulf-waters-iran-retaliation-threats.html" target="_blank">U.S. warships</a> are moving closer to Iranian waters as Tehran and its allies ramp up retaliation threats. The tension is building after intelligence briefings suggested Iran's government is weaker than it appears.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A South African court ruled that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela memorabilia</a> can proceed to auction, ending a family dispute over who controls the former president's legacy items.</p>

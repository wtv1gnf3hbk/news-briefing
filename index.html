  <div id="content">
<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The fallout from that Minneapolis shooting continues to rock Washington, with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/shooting-dhs-turmoil.html" target="_blank">Department of Homeland Security</a> in complete turmoil and congressional leadership scrambling to prevent a government shutdown. The crisis has deepened with news that ICE <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/29/us/minnesota-ice-shooting-minneapolis" target="_blank">violated nearly 100</a> court orders, adding legal chaos to the political firestorm.</p><p>What's fascinating is how this domestic crisis is intersecting with international tensions. As Trump threatens Iran with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html" target="_blank">"massive armada"</a> and Tehran warns of quick retaliation, America's allies are quietly hedging their bets. Starmer's in Beijing cutting deals with Xi Jinping, including visa-free travel for UK citizens to China. It's a clear signal that America's partners aren't waiting around to see how this all plays out.</p><p>The political stakes couldn't be higher. Trump and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/trump-schumer-deal-shutdown.html" target="_blank">Schumer are talking</a> about a potential deal to avoid a shutdown, but Democrats want Homeland Security funding yanked unless there are major reforms. It's a high-stakes game of chicken that could paralyze the government just as international crises are heating up.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Meta's betting the farm on AI with plans to spend <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/meta-earnings-ai-spending.html" target="_blank">at least $115 billion</a> this year. That's a staggering number that shows how seriously Zuckerberg's taking the AI arms race, even as investors are getting antsy about when all this spending will actually pay off.</p><p>• Tesla's not being outdone, announcing a <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOS2phRzllUWhwMzBjMXg1UkJlN1VFWXljbG5LTlJSQkdCNFJONEx1bG9NUXF6S09yaXlXUkhKeVdGVHE3N0o1eUwwNjEtYmctcjJ2RUNRUC1TMWxpX1FzYjhyVklubFRoT1NwQTVQYVdfVC1QN3B3RHE2c0ptZlRMQmIzSEpELWFkSWExRUJ6blkxS05VQWxESmVJSTg0aGtIUlJpNUh2UDJ3NnEwbkFZbHlCMlR2OVNtRFcwZ0ZrR01HUHVId3owWWV4MmdzUmxtcXhmRFRmRXE?oc=5" target="_blank">$20 billion</a> capital spending spree as Musk pushes hard into autonomous driving and robotics, per Reuters.</p><p>• Amazon's cutting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">16,000 jobs</a> in another massive layoff round, while simultaneously drawing heat for promoting Melania Trump's documentary. The timing's raising questions about whether Amazon's trying to curry favor with the White House.</p><p>• Russia's Lukoil is reportedly in talks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/russia-lukoil-carlyle-sale-sanctions.html" target="_blank">sell assets</a> to U.S. investment firm Carlyle Group. It's a complex sanctions dance that shows how money finds a way even when geopolitics get messy.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: A plane carrying Colombian politicians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/americas/colombian-plane-politicians-missing.html" target="_blank">crashed in an area</a> contested by rebel groups. It's a stark reminder of how fragile security remains in parts of Colombia, even years after the FARC peace deal.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Greenlanders are watching America's domestic chaos and basically saying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/europe/greenland-trump-anxiety-american-turmoil.html" target="_blank">"no thanks"</a> to Trump's acquisition dreams. The irony couldn't be thicker as Trump talks about territorial expansion while his own government teeters on the edge.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: China's continuing to navigate its economic contradictions, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/china-economy-duality.html" target="_blank">new reporting</a> from the world's busiest port showing just how unbalanced the economy really is. Export containers are flowing out while import areas sit relatively empty.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Netanyahu's making a bold declaration that Israel will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/middleeast/israel-us-aid-weapons-gaza-biden-netanyahu.html" target="_blank">cut reliance</a> on U.S. military aid, citing Biden-era delays. It's classic Netanyahu political theater, but it also reflects real tensions about weapons supplies during the Gaza campaign.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: South Africa's facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">fresh U.S. scrutiny</a> after conducting naval drills with Iran. It's exactly the kind of "you're with us or against us" pressure that's going to define Trump's foreign policy approach.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Supreme Court has been quietly expanding its secrecy operations in ways that would make even the CIA proud. Our investigation reveals the Court has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/supreme-court-nondisclosure-agreements.html" target="_blank">requiring unprecedented</a> nondisclosure agreements from staff and contractors, essentially building a wall of silence around an institution that's already the most opaque branch of government. This matters because it comes as the Court faces mounting scrutiny over ethics violations and its role in reshaping American law with minimal public accountability.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's a small but significant breakthrough in Gaza. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/middleeast/gaza-rafah-border-crossing.html" target="_blank">Rafah crossing</a> between Gaza and Egypt has reopened for the first time in months, allowing critically ill Palestinians to finally get medical treatment abroad. It's one of the clearest signs yet that the fragile cease-fire is holding, even as tragic reminders persist. Al Jazeera reports a child was killed by Israeli fire as families prepared to leave through the crossing.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• OpenAI's in talks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html" target="_blank">raise funding</a> that could value the company at $100 billion, which would cement its position as the most valuable AI startup on the planet.</p><p>• China's trying to have it both ways on AI development. Beijing wants to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/china-ai-regulations.html" target="_blank">dominate globally</a> while keeping tight regulatory control at home, creating a fascinating tension between innovation and authoritarianism.</p><p>• The AI boom could make your next computer a lot pricier. Chip shortages driven by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/ai-memory-chips-pc-smartphone.html" target="_blank">AI memory demands</a> are starting to hit consumer electronics, according to industry analysts.</p><p>• Wall Street's hottest trades are starting to unravel. Bloomberg reports that everything from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-02/from-silver-to-asia-tech-wall-street-s-hot-trades-are-unraveling" target="_blank">silver to</a> Asian tech stocks are seeing dramatic reversals as investors reassess crowded bets.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Colombia's leftist president Gustavo Petro is heading to the White House this week for what promises to be a fascinating diplomatic dance. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/world/americas/colombia-petro-trump-white-house.html" target="_blank">outspoken Trump critic</a> will need to navigate his previous harsh rhetoric about the administration while protecting Colombia's interests.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure again, killing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/europe/russia-strikes-ukraine-energy-sector-killing-12-miners.html" target="_blank">12 miners</a> in what appears to be Moscow's continued strategy of grinding down civilian morale through infrastructure attacks.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Indonesia has lifted its ban on Grok after getting new assurances from X Corp. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html" target="_blank">reversal shows</a> how quickly tech diplomacy can shift when companies make the right commitments to government regulators.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Iran arrested an Oscar-nominated screenwriter for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/middleeast/iran-mehdi-mahmoudian-arrest.html" target="_blank">criticizing the regime</a>, showing the government's continued crackdown on dissent extends even to internationally recognized artists.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Egypt's been secretly operating an air base that's become central to Sudan's devastating drone war. Our investigation reveals how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html" target="_blank">Cairo's involvement</a> is escalating a conflict that's already displaced millions.</p>

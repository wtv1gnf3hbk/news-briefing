<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The long saga over TikTok's future in America is finally over. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance-china-us.html" target="_blank">TikTok struck</a> a deal to create a new U.S. entity that ends years of legal battles and national security concerns. The restructuring involves Oracle and other American investors taking significant stakes while ByteDance maintains some ownership. For the app's 170 million American users, the changes should be largely invisible, though the deal represents a major shift in how Chinese tech companies operate globally.</p><p>The resolution comes as Chinese firms are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/business/tiktok-china-technology.html" target="_blank">searching for</a> new ways to expand internationally without triggering the kind of regulatory backlash that nearly killed TikTok. The precedent here could reshape how Beijing's tech giants approach Western markets, especially as U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer over technology and data security.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxONGVXczl4aF9XZU5QZ0I1eGJCLXZuRnFnSjFNR2ROd1hiYkRMS0lZNEVxV0I4SjZQd0RaQmVsMlZwTUNKcGtHWEVGdnp3RS1BVUFpWXlBSGhhakdoSS1ORVFuWkk3SHE3dlV0R09EbTJTRlB5eTVPaW5aRUw3VE91U3gxZUVrdWJkclRhenNLUjFmZnU3Y1FwR0ctYzBVd29mRldlVi1B?oc=5" target="_blank">China's launching</a> LNG futures trading as soon as next month, according to Reuters. It's Beijing's latest move to challenge Western dominance in commodity pricing and give Asian buyers more leverage in energy markets.</p><p>• Euro zone business activity is <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxNUFpkTG5hUmVlTVJ2dC16Uk5FTmlYSFJkV1ExaVR6WFRKZGJUQVlWSWtlbEEzRVJHclZqT05pRnA1R09udlZaa3FWZlBJZThHV2lHekZNbGJuVmhpQkpITnRObEZJXzZKY0tmS2dtbXZ0NVFhb1ZXSTlPa2JPdjRIVkxTb21ZdHlJZnNpNnRJODJGLVVyWGJYR1hkR0ViZjlrclJELUR6c3Z3QkMweXl0YXJHdDQ?oc=5" target="_blank">expanding steadily</a> but price pressures are creeping back, Reuters reports. That's going to complicate the European Central Bank's next moves on interest rates.</p><p>• Russia's Sberbank is <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQTW52dWFxelkyS294MUFYbkF4NWdOcXAtS2c1RnJHUnFYSG5BRGtuLW5jZTFtRWlWZFBNVDlXRWtwNUYtaGt4T0RCWlZJYXlVVVl0eWZYWUY4endYby1uWjFmb0ktck9rempyQ1VKQ0QzMW13RU43aUlPVjdDMUhhTkpHc09DQjJrX3RXMVUzNU02bENPSEpuaE11am5XeWU4TUwzRi1RSWV2VURRTU1zWDVYUUoxRG5sdlNB?oc=5" target="_blank">taking stakes</a> in tech companies as Putin pushes for technological sovereignty, according to Reuters. It's part of Moscow's broader effort to insulate Russian tech from Western sanctions.</p><p>• Bloomberg notes that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-23/emerging-markets-are-on-fire-as-traders-look-away-from-us" target="_blank">emerging markets</a> are rallying as investors look beyond the dollar. Rising U.S.-Europe tensions are weakening the greenback and driving capital toward alternative markets.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America:</strong> Peru's president faces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/americas/peru-president-chinese-businessmen-meetings.html" target="_blank">potential ouster</a> over secret meetings with Chinese businessmen. The scandal highlights how China's growing influence in Latin America creates new political vulnerabilities for regional leaders.</p><p>• <strong>Europe:</strong> Ukrainian, Russian and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-us-peace-talks-abu-dhabi.html" target="_blank">U.S. officials</a> will meet in Abu Dhabi for peace talks. It's the most serious diplomatic effort in months to find an off-ramp to the war, though expectations remain low.</p><p>• <strong>Asia:</strong> Vietnam's leader is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/asia/vietnam-lam-power-congress.html" target="_blank">consolidating power</a> while pledging a "new era of prosperity." The moves reflect Hanoi's efforts to balance economic growth with Communist Party control as the country navigates U.S.-China competition.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East:</strong> The U.S. laid out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/middleeast/us-gaza-peace-trump-kushner-davos.html" target="_blank">glittering plans</a> for Gaza's reconstruction, including skyscrapers and modern infrastructure. The vision, unveiled at Davos, faces enormous practical and political obstacles but signals Trump's approach to Middle East peace.</p><p>• <strong>Africa:</strong> Kennedy's plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-africa-study.html" target="_blank">test vaccines</a> on West African babies has been blocked by health authorities. The controversy reflects growing scrutiny of medical research in Africa and concerns about exploiting vulnerable populations.</p>

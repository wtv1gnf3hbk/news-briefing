<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-kennedy-center.html" target="_blank">Kennedy Center</a> is getting a dramatic makeover. Trump announced yesterday that the Washington cultural landmark will close for a full two years starting this fall for what he's calling a "complete reconstruction." It's a bold move that'll leave the capital without one of its premier venues for performing arts, though the administration says it's necessary to modernize the 55-year-old building. The timing raises eyebrows given Trump's historically tense relationship with the arts establishment.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Epstein files continue to send shockwaves through political circles on both sides of the Atlantic. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8jm2vpve1o" target="_blank">Lord Mandelson</a> resigned from the Labour Party overnight to avoid what he called "further embarrassment" over his documented contacts with the late sex offender, according to the BBC. The fallout's reaching as far as Norway, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/01/norway-crown-princess-contact-epstein-files-appear-to-show" target="_blank">Crown Princess</a> Mette-Marit is facing scrutiny over what appear to be years of contact with Epstein.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• China's taking an interesting approach to AI dominance. Beijing wants its tech giants to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/china-ai-regulations.html" target="_blank">move fast</a> on artificial intelligence development but within strict regulatory guardrails, a strategy that could give it an edge over Silicon Valley's more chaotic approach.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html" target="_blank">OpenAI's shopping</a> for a massive funding round that could reach $100 billion, which would cement its position as the most valuable AI startup in the world.</p><p>• Markets are getting choppy. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-01/dollar-firms-stocks-look-weaker-as-sentiment-ebbs-markets-wrap" target="_blank">Gold and silver</a> took a beating along with stocks in what Bloomberg calls a dramatic reversal from January's bullish run.</p><p>• That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/politics/trump-crypto-uae-world-liberty.html" target="_blank">UAE crypto connection</a> to Trump's family business is raising new questions about potential conflicts of interest, with a firm from the Emirates quietly taking a stake in World Liberty Financial.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/americas/costa-rica-election-fernandez.html" target="_blank">Costa Rica's heading</a> toward a major political shift, with right-wing candidate Laura Fernández leading early returns in the presidential election. Her law-and-order platform resonated with voters worried about rising crime in what's traditionally been Central America's most stable democracy.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Russia struck Ukraine's energy infrastructure again, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/europe/russia-strikes-ukraine-energy-sector-killing-12-miners.html" target="_blank">killing 12 miners</a> in what appears to be part of Moscow's winter campaign to cripple Ukrainian power supplies. The attack comes as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-us-peace-talks.html" target="_blank">peace talks</a> face new delays despite recent US-Russia diplomatic contacts.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/asia/indonesia-lift-grok-ban.html" target="_blank">Indonesia lifted</a> its ban on Elon Musk's Grok AI after getting new assurances from X Corp about content moderation, ending a standoff that highlighted how governments are grappling with AI oversight.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Iran's escalating its crackdown on dissent. Authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/middleeast/iran-mehdi-mahmoudian-arrest.html" target="_blank">arrested an Oscar-nominated</a> screenwriter for criticizing the regime, while <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/israel-partially-reopens-rafah-crossing-in-pilot" target="_blank">ambulances line up</a> at Gaza's Rafah crossing as Israel begins what it's calling a "pilot reopening" of the crucial border passage.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: New reporting reveals how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/world/africa/egypt-sudan-drones.html" target="_blank">Egypt's been running</a> a secret air base that's fueling Sudan's devastating drone war, underscoring how regional powers are quietly shaping conflicts across the continent.</p>

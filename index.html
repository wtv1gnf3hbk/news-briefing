<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/don-lemon-arrest-minnesota-church-protest.html" target="_blank">Don Lemon arrest</a> at a Minnesota church protest is capturing attention this morning, but it's really part of a much bigger story about how Trump's immigration crackdown is playing out on the ground. The former CNN host's detention during an anti-ICE demonstration shows how these protests are drawing high-profile figures into direct confrontation with federal authorities. Meanwhile, we're also getting a massive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/30/us/epstein-files-release" target="_blank">Epstein document dump</a> from the Justice Department today - more than three million pages that could shed new light on the financier's connections to powerful figures.</p><p>What's particularly striking is how the Minnesota situation is becoming a test case for American federalism. The state's resistance to federal immigration enforcement has created <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/magazine/minnesota-investigation-state-federalism.html" target="_blank">real tensions</a> about how our system of government actually works when Washington and state capitals are pulling in opposite directions. It's not just about immigration policy anymore - it's about whether the federal system itself can hold together under this kind of pressure.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html" target="_blank">OpenAI's reportedly</a> in talks to raise up to $100 billion, which would make it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The AI arms race isn't slowing down.</p><p>• Kevin Warsh's nomination to lead the Fed is already <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/us-stocks-slide-after-trump-s-fed-chair-pick-hotter-ppi-data" target="_blank">moving markets</a> - the dollar's having its best day since July as traders bet he'll take a more hawkish stance than Powell.</p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/business/media/washington-post-newsroom.html" target="_blank">Washington Post is planning</a> significant newsroom cuts as it tries to reshape itself financially. Another sign of the ongoing struggles in traditional media.</p><p>• Tech companies are already helping ICE track protesters through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/technology/tech-ice-facial-recognition-palantir.html" target="_blank">facial recognition and data</a> from firms like Palantir, showing how surveillance capabilities are being deployed in real-time.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Argentina's in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/americas/argentina-us-deportations-immigrants-milei.html" target="_blank">advanced talks</a> to become a destination for U.S. deportations under Trump's immigration crackdown. Milei's government sees an opportunity to strengthen ties with Washington, but it could create serious domestic political challenges.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: The Netherlands is getting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/europe/netherlands-government-rob-jetten.html" target="_blank">a new government</a>, but whether it'll actually last is the real question. Dutch politics has been notoriously unstable lately, and this coalition faces some serious challenges from day one.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/asia/crying-horse-toy-china.html" target="_blank">crying toy horse</a> born from a factory mistake has become an unlikely symbol of China's current mood. Sometimes the most random cultural phenomena capture something deeper about a country's psychological state.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Syria's new government just sealed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/world/middleeast/syria-kurd-sdf-agreement.html" target="_blank">a deal</a> with Kurdish-led militias to merge their forces. It's a significant step toward consolidating control after Assad's fall, but the details of how this actually works will be crucial.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Devastating floods have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/world/africa/mozambique-south-africa-flood.html" target="_blank">displaced hundreds of thousands</a> across southern Africa, according to Reuters. The scale of the displacement shows how climate disasters continue to create massive humanitarian challenges across the region.</p>

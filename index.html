<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Federal immigration enforcement is spinning dangerously out of control in Minneapolis, where ICE agents have now killed two US citizens in less than a week. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/politics/second-ice-shooting-minneapolis.html" target="_blank">second fatal shooting</a> has prompted Minnesota's governor to deploy the National Guard as protests intensify. What's particularly damning is that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice" target="_blank">videos appear</a> to contradict federal agents' accounts of what happened, raising serious questions about accountability in Trump's immigration crackdown.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mother Nature's delivering her own crisis as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/25/us/winter-storm-snow-ice" target="_blank">major storm</a> barrels toward the Northeast with potentially crippling snow and ice. We're talking about a foot of snow for New York City and widespread power outages that have already triggered grid emergencies across multiple states. The timing couldn't be worse for a country already dealing with political turmoil.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• TikTok's got a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance-china-us" target="_blank">new structure</a> that officially ends its legal saga in the US, though the details of who actually owns what remain murky as Oracle and other American investors take control.</p><p>• Vanguard just crossed a massive milestone, topping <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPeFMtRm1IRjB6Q2ZmSUZ6VS1HV3VPbTZ2Z1htZ0RvT0FsNkRHSlhhVWQzbnRvZzJEeXA0RkVlYnM4QjRJZ2YyWE0yOTMzMHczbUJKcDFxQXJEUDItdUFON20zT0oyejRSSDlLSlQtbjFscFZpSTJ0REk5VXVleDZIZVRyTUplMnFtZTZjbGJndTgxTHgyOUE3bXczMWRqVFU?oc=5" target="_blank">$1 trillion</a> in assets outside the US according to the Financial Times, a sign of how American money managers are globalizing.</p><p>• The Washington Post is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/business/media/washington-post-winter-olympics.html" target="_blank">scrapping plans</a> to cover the Winter Olympics, another cost-cutting move that signals deeper troubles in media economics.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuelan families are desperately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/world/americas/in-venezuela-families-search-for-relatives-who-are-detained-and-missing.html" target="_blank">searching for relatives</a> who've been detained and disappeared since the disputed election, highlighting the continuing crackdown under Maduro's regime.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Ukraine peace talks wrapped up on what Zelensky called a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/europe/ukraine-us-russia-peace-talks.html" target="_blank">positive note</a>, with hints of future meetings that could signal the first real diplomatic opening in years of war.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Xi Jinping's military purge has claimed another victim as China's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/asia/china-top-general-xi-military-purge.html" target="_blank">top general</a> falls from grace, part of Xi's broader effort to consolidate control over the People's Liberation Army.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Syria's new government announced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/middleeast/syria-kurdish-militia.html" target="_blank">cease-fire extension</a> with Kurdish forces just hours after their previous truce expired, buying more time for fragile negotiations.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A South African court ruled that Nelson Mandela's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html" target="_blank">personal memorabilia</a> can proceed to auction, ending a legal battle over items that include keys to his Robben Island prison cell.</p>

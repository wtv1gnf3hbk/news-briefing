<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The United States is bracing for a potentially crippling winter storm that has officials across the South particularly worried about widespread ice accumulation. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/weather/winter-storm-ice-tennessee-carolina-mississippi.html" target="_blank">forecast shows</a> dangerous ice conditions stretching from Tennessee to the Carolinas and Mississippi, the kind of weather that can snap power lines and make roads impassable for days. It's a stark reminder of how unprepared much of the South's infrastructure is for severe winter weather.</p><p>Meanwhile, the domestic immigration enforcement story continues to evolve in ways that are creating real political friction. We're seeing everything from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/minnesota-businesses-protest-ice.html" target="_blank">massive protests</a> in Minneapolis to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/ice-agent-charged-illinois.html" target="_blank">ICE agent</a> being charged with a misdemeanor in Illinois after a scuffle with an activist. There's also a troubling incident where someone was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/minneapolis-man-pepper-sprayed-pinned-video.html" target="_blank">pepper-sprayed while</a> being held down by officers, sparking widespread outrage. The enforcement push is clearly generating the kind of confrontations that could complicate the administration's broader immigration agenda.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• TikTok's ownership saga finally has a resolution. The company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance-china-us.html" target="_blank">struck a</a> deal to create a new U.S. entity, ending years of legal battles over Chinese ownership concerns.</p><p>• The SEC is backing down on crypto enforcement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/politics/sec-crypto-winklevoss.html" target="_blank">dropping its</a> case against the Winklevoss twins' cryptocurrency firm. It's another sign of how the regulatory landscape is shifting under the new administration.</p><p>• Mining stocks are suddenly the hottest thing in global markets, according to Bloomberg. Fund managers are betting on a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-24/mining-stocks-on-cusp-of-supercycle-as-ai-boom-stokes-metals" target="_blank">supercycle driven</a> by AI's voracious appetite for metals and tight mineral supplies.</p><p>• Japanese authorities might be preparing to intervene in currency markets to prop up the yen, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/yen-jumps-most-since-august-as-risk-of-intervention-ramps-up" target="_blank">possibly with</a> rare U.S. assistance, Bloomberg reports.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's crackdown on dissent has reached absurd new heights. Authorities are now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/americas/venezuela-arrests-repression.html" target="_blank">charging people</a> with treason over something as innocent as a water balloon fight, showing just how paranoid the Maduro regime has become about any form of public gathering.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: A U.S. Navy veteran has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/europe/russia-jails-american-sailor-chuck-zimmerman.html" target="_blank">sentenced to</a> five years in a Russian prison, adding another American to Moscow's growing collection of detained foreigners who seem to be held as bargaining chips.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Xi Jinping's military purge has reached the very top of China's command structure. The country's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/asia/china-top-general-xi-military-purge.html" target="_blank">highest-ranking general</a> has been removed, signaling that no one is safe from Xi's drive to consolidate control over the People's Liberation Army.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Iran's leadership is showing serious signs of weakness after years of war and domestic protests. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/middleeast/iran-protests-ayatollah-revolutionary-guards.html" target="_blank">ayatollah and</a> his Revolutionary Guards are struggling to maintain their grip on power as economic pressure and public dissent mount.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A South African court has ruled that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela</a> memorabilia can proceed to auction, resolving a legal dispute over the anti-apartheid leader's personal items and their rightful ownership.</p>

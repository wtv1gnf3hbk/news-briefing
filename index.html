<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Epstein saga took another turn yesterday as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/clintons-epstein-testify.html" target="_blank">Clintons agreed</a> to testify before Congress, prompting House leaders to cancel their contempt vote. It's a significant development in what's become a sprawling investigation touching multiple countries. The fallout continues rippling across the Atlantic, where London's Met Police have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/03/met-police-to-launch-investigation-into-alleged-mandelson-epstein-email-leaks" target="_blank">launched an investigation</a> into alleged email leaks involving Peter Mandelson, the UK's newly appointed ambassador to Washington.</p><p>The timing couldn't be more awkward for Keir Starmer's government, which is now defending Mandelson's appointment as questions swirl about his past connections. Meanwhile, new court documents reveal who would have inherited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/jeffrey-epstein-trust-inherit-karyna-shuliak.html" target="_blank">Epstein's fortune</a>, adding another layer to the unfolding story. It's becoming clear this isn't going away anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/walmart-trillion-market-value.html" target="_blank">Walmart joined</a> the exclusive trillion-dollar market cap club, making it the latest retail giant to reach that milestone alongside the tech heavyweights.</p><p>• Elon Musk is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html" target="_blank">merging SpaceX</a> with his AI startup xAI in a move that consolidates his sprawling tech empire under one roof.</p><p>• Netflix's Ted Sarandos faced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/media/netflix-sarandos-warner-senate-hearing.html" target="_blank">skeptical lawmakers</a> over the proposed Warner deal, with senators pressing him on competition concerns.</p><p>• The AI boom is starting to hit consumers where it hurts. New analysis shows how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/ai-memory-chips-pc-smartphone.html" target="_blank">memory chip shortages</a> driven by AI demand could make your next PC or smartphone significantly pricier.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's authoritarian grip appears to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/americas/venezuela-rodriguez-maduro-authoritarian.html" target="_blank">loosening slightly</a>, but analysts are questioning whether this represents genuine reform or just tactical repositioning by the Maduro regime.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/europe/winter-olympics-security-milan-cortina.html" target="_blank">2026 Winter Olympics</a> in Milan and Cortina are deploying an unprecedented security apparatus, complete with robots, drones, and a dedicated cyber command center to protect athletes and spectators.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Japan's brutal winter continues to claim lives, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/asia/japan-snow-deaths.html" target="_blank">at least 30 people</a> now confirmed dead after weeks of record snowfall that's paralyzed parts of the country.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: A major blow to Libya's Gaddafi legacy as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/middleeast/libya-seif-al-islam-el-qaddafi-killed.html" target="_blank">Seif al-Islam</a>, the dictator's son who once seemed poised to inherit power, was reportedly killed in an attack according to his lawyer.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Health officials are sounding alarms about a potential resurgence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/health/neglected-tropical-diseases-usaid-ntds-river-blindness.html" target="_blank">"biblical diseases"</a> across Africa, including river blindness and other neglected tropical diseases that could affect millions.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">escalating his tariff</a> strategy after the Supreme Court struck down parts of his original trade policy, now announcing a 15 percent global tariff on all imports. This move comes as the Court's conservative justices showed unexpected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html" target="_blank">divisions over Trump's agenda</a>, with Justice Gorsuch delivering what many see as a subtle rebuke to an overreaching executive branch. The ruling has left global businesses navigating what one analyst called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/tariffs-supreme-court-global-busines-reaction.html" target="_blank">"murky waters"</a> as they try to figure out what comes next.</p><p>The broader trade war is creating ripple effects everywhere from India's oil purchases to European inflation rates. Meanwhile, consumers are stuck in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/tariff-ruling-consumer-prices.html" target="_blank">waiting game</a> trying to figure out when and how much prices might rise. Trump also moved to close the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-deminimis-loophole-closed.html" target="_blank">"de minimis" loophole</a> that allowed cheap imports under $800 to enter duty-free, targeting the flood of packages from Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p><ul><li>Honeywell is thinking about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/honeywell-considers-walking-away-from-johnson-matthey-catalyst-deal" target="_blank">walking away</a> from its acquisition of Johnson Matthey's catalyst business, according to Bloomberg, as deal-making gets trickier in this environment.</li></p>

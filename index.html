<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Trump administration's immigration crackdown has taken a deadly turn in Minneapolis, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/alex-jeffrey-pretti-was-an-icu-nurse-at-the-va-hospital.html" target="_blank">ICE agents shot</a> and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen and ICU nurse at a VA hospital. It's the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/politics/second-ice-shooting-minneapolis.html" target="_blank">second fatal shooting</a> by federal agents in the city this week, and the details are sparking fierce debate about enforcement tactics. Gun rights activists are pushing back against suggestions that Pretti's possession of a pistol justified the killing, while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/democrats-congress-reaction.html" target="_blank">Democrats in Congress</a> are threatening to block ICE funding entirely.</p><p>Meanwhile, a massive winter storm is paralyzing much of the country, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/24/weather/winter-storm-snow-ice" target="_blank">over 14,500 flights grounded</a> and power grid emergencies declared across multiple states. Bloomberg reports the storm could dump a foot of snow on New York City alone. The timing couldn't be worse for the administration, which is already dealing with political fallout from the Minneapolis shootings.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/business/media/washington-post-winter-olympics.html" target="_blank">Washington Post scrapped</a> its plans to cover the Winter Olympics entirely, another sign of the media industry's continued belt-tightening as traditional revenue models collapse.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/tiktok-deal-oracle-bytedance-china-us.html" target="_blank">TikTok's ownership saga</a> finally wrapped up with a complex deal creating a new U.S. entity, though the exact ownership structure between Oracle, ByteDance, and other investors remains murky.</p><p>• An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/technology/claude-code.html" target="_blank">AI coding tool</a> called Claude is going viral as users discover creative applications beyond just writing software, from automating spreadsheets to generating creative content.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/your-money/401k-contributions-catch-up-roth-retirement.html" target="_blank">New 401(k) rules</a> for 2026 are changing how "catch-up" contributions work for older Americans, with some now required to go into Roth accounts rather than traditional pre-tax savings.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Colombia lost one of its most important chroniclers when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/arts/design/beatriz-gonzalez-dead.html" target="_blank">Beatriz González died</a> at 93. The artist spent decades documenting her country's violence and turmoil through haunting paintings that became symbols of resilience.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/europe/ukraine-us-russia-peace-talks.html" target="_blank">Ukraine peace talks</a> wrapped up with no breakthrough but what Zelensky called a "constructive" tone. The trilateral discussions with the U.S. may resume next month as fighting continues on the ground.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Xi Jinping's military purge claimed another high-profile victim as China announced it's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/asia/china-top-general-xi-military-purge.html" target="_blank">investigating its top general</a> for unspecified "serious violations." The probe continues Xi's systematic cleanup of the People's Liberation Army leadership.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Syria's new government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/world/middleeast/syria-kurdish-militia.html" target="_blank">extended its ceasefire</a> with Kurdish militias just hours after the original truce expired, buying more time for negotiations in the country's fragile transition.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A South African court ruled that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela memorabilia</a> can proceed to auction despite family objections, ending a legal battle over items that include personal letters and photographs from the anti-apartheid leader's estate.</p>

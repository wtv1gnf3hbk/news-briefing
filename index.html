<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The world's getting a front-row seat to Trump 2.0 in action, and it's making everyone pretty nervous. The president's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news" target="_blank">doubling down</a> on his Greenland threats — he says he'll "100%" impose tariffs on Denmark if they don't play ball — and European leaders are pushing back hard. It's not just diplomatic theater: markets are spooked, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news#stocks-trump-greenland-tariffs" target="_blank">U.S. stocks tumbling</a> on fears of a transatlantic trade war.</p><p>The timing couldn't be more dramatic, with world leaders gathering at Davos where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/europe/davos-trump-europe.html" target="_blank">Trump's presence</a> is casting a shadow over everything. Canada's prime minister captured the mood, declaring there's been a "rupture" in the world order. Meanwhile, the EU's foreign policy chief is warning they'll "hold their ground" — diplomatic speak for "bring it on." What we're watching is Trump testing just how far he can push America's allies, and the early returns suggest we're in for a bumpy ride.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNRXNNMU1IWkF0VUM1YnBsYl96ZXI4WWQ4ajR1VjMtZHl2TDY0aTBVdEFYVjlCS0J1OUVvbldPQ0h3YlNfakluZDdtQURadjA2VFFzeXZFdl9fVlhjZjRsbjY0WlpOTmVrSE5zeTB" target="_blank">AstraZeneca's planning</a> to ditch Nasdaq for the NYSE next month — a rare transatlantic switch that says something about where the financial action is, per Reuters.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/business/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-takeover.html" target="_blank">Netflix is revamping</a> its Warner Bros. bid to try to block Paramount's takeover attempt, setting up what could be a messy Hollywood battle.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-20/stripe-s-collison-says-no-rush-for-payment-firm-to-go-public" target="_blank">Stripe's co-founder says</a> there's no "rush" for the payment giant to go public, which probably disappoints investors who've been waiting for that IPO payday.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html" target="_blank">An A.I. startup</a> is making the familiar pitch that it wants to empower workers, not replace them — though we've heard that song before.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/americas/venezuela-prisoner-release.html" target="_blank">A Venezuelan political prisoner</a> has finally been released and made it home, offering a rare bit of hope amid the country's ongoing political crisis.</p><p>• <strong>Europe:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2qjy9l4yo" target="_blank">Spain's investigators</a> are focusing on a possible gap in the railway track after that devastating train crash, while the country continues mourning the victims and working to recover people still trapped in the wreckage.</p><p>• <strong>Asia:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/asia/isis-kabul-bomb-china.html" target="_blank">ISIS claimed responsibility</a> for a deadly bombing at a Chinese restaurant in Kabul, highlighting how Afghanistan remains dangerous even under Taliban rule and how foreign businesses remain targets.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East:</strong> There's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/middleeast/syria-isis-camp-al-hol-kurds.html" target="_blank">complete chaos</a> at a camp housing ISIS families after Kurdish-led forces stopped providing security — a reminder of how fragile Syria's post-Assad transition remains.</p><p>• <strong>Africa:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html" target="_blank">Church leaders say</a> over 160 people were kidnapped in Nigeria, though officials are denying it happened — the conflicting accounts highlighting how hard it is to get reliable information about security in the region.</p>

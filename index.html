<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>While international outlets are consumed by the Peter Mandelson-Epstein scandal (he's resigned from the Lords after police opened an investigation into alleged email leaks), the U.S. is fixated on something decidedly more surreal. A massive golden statue dubbed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/technology/trump-statue-don-colossus.html" target="_blank">"Don Colossus"</a> depicting Trump is sitting somewhere, waiting for a permanent home. It's the kind of story that captures how Trump's second presidency continues to blur the lines between politics and spectacle.</p><p>The more substantive story is Trump's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/colombia-petro-trump-meeting.html" target="_blank">meeting with Colombia's president</a> at the White House today, as the administration tries to reset relations after tensions over deportation flights. Meanwhile, the immigration crackdown continues to dominate headlines, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/03/us/minneapolis-ice-immigration" target="_blank">ongoing ICE operations</a> in Minneapolis drawing particular scrutiny from federal oversight bodies and state attorneys general.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/disney-damaro-ceo.html" target="_blank">Disney's named</a> Josh D'Amaro as its next CEO, picking the theme parks chief to lead the entertainment giant through its next chapter. He's got experience turning around the post-pandemic parks business.</p><p>• Waymo just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/waymo-funding-growth.html" target="_blank">raised $16 billion</a> to fuel its global expansion plans. That's a massive bet on autonomous vehicles becoming mainstream sooner rather than later.</p><p>• Santander's making a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/santander-weighs-deal-to-buy-us-based-webster-financial" target="_blank">major U.S. play</a>, agreeing to buy Webster Financial for $12.2 billion according to Bloomberg. It's one of the largest U.S. deals ever by a European bank.</p><p>• Intel's CEO says the company <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNcFhqZWNRMzZSY0xtWTVJeHdoMC1pemFYc3BRbnRXbWtOaTVKYWxadjlyS2dOVWVyOUN3WTRNSEhHblZwQXFOR1ZJSWR4dXdFdk5wZnpGRTYzSW1ZdmZmSzJMd1g0dkpfNDdBNV9fRWw0aWQ2b216N2I4azZreVVnbUdTSGlmSzBmS2hES2hiNjI3em5pTTdPa2w3OWRUNi14ZWQ1SUEwOUFHX1k?oc=5" target="_blank">will make GPUs</a>, taking direct aim at Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. That's a bold move for a company that's been struggling to stay relevant.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's authoritarian grip is showing signs of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/americas/venezuela-rodriguez-maduro-authoritarian.html" target="_blank">loosening slightly</a>, but the big question is whether this represents genuine reform or just tactical breathing room for Maduro's regime as it faces mounting pressure.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Spain's prime minister wants to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/spain-social-media-ban-under-16.html" target="_blank">ban social media</a> for kids under 16, following Australia's lead. It's part of a growing global movement to protect children from platforms that critics say are designed to be addictive.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: There are signs of serious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/china-xi-military-purge.html" target="_blank">ruptures in China's leadership</a>, possibly driven by Xi Jinping's paranoia and internal power struggles. Meanwhile, Japan's dealing with deadly winter weather that's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/asia/japan-snow-deaths.html" target="_blank">killed at least 30</a> people.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Iran's president is backing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/middleeast/iran-president-talks-istanbul-witkoff-kushner.html" target="_blank">"fair" talks</a> with the U.S. as tensions mount. It's a potentially significant opening, though Iran has made similar overtures before that led nowhere.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Health officials are warning that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/health/neglected-tropical-diseases-usaid-ntds-river-blindness.html" target="_blank">"biblical diseases"</a> like river blindness could surge across the continent if global health funding gets cut. It's a reminder of how interconnected global health security really is.</p>

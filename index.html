<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The big corporate story today is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/walmart-trillion-market-value.html" target="_blank">Walmart hitting</a> that coveted $1 trillion market cap, joining the exclusive club with Apple, Microsoft, and the other tech giants. It's a remarkable moment for a company that started as a discount retailer in Arkansas and shows how the lines between tech and traditional retail have completely blurred.</p><p>But there's a darker story dominating headlines across the Atlantic. U.K. police are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/peter-mandelson-uk-epstein.html" target="_blank">investigating Peter Mandelson</a>, the former British ambassador to the U.S., over allegations he leaked information to Jeffrey Epstein. This comes as authorities are also reviewing fresh claims about Prince Andrew's connections to the convicted sex trafficker. The Epstein web keeps expanding, and it's creating serious political headaches for the British establishment just as these relationships seemed to be fading from public attention.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/disney-damaro-ceo.html" target="_blank">Disney named</a> Josh D'Amaro as its next CEO, ending months of succession speculation. He's been running the parks division and will take over from Bob Iger, who's finally stepping aside after his extended tenure.</p><p>• Elon Musk is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html" target="_blank">merging SpaceX</a> with his AI startup xAI in a move that combines his space ambitions with artificial intelligence development. It's classic Musk empire building.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/waymo-funding-growth.html" target="_blank">Waymo raised</a> a massive $16 billion to fuel its global expansion plans, signaling that autonomous vehicles are still attracting serious investor interest despite years of overpromising.</p><p>• There's now a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/moltbook-ai-social-media.html" target="_blank">social network</a> exclusively for AI bots called Moltbook. No humans allowed. It's either the future of digital interaction or a glimpse into our dystopian tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/americas/venezuela-rodriguez-maduro-authoritarian.html" target="_blank">Venezuela's authoritarian grip</a> appears to be loosening slightly under pressure, but analysts are questioning whether this represents genuine change or just tactical maneuvering by Maduro's regime.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Beyond the Mandelson investigation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2nddvmryo" target="_blank">Spain announced</a> plans to ban social media for anyone under 16, following Australia's lead in trying to protect kids from what Prime Minister Sánchez called the "digital Wild West."</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/asia/japan-snow-deaths.html" target="_blank">At least 30 people</a> have died in Japan after weeks of unusually heavy snowfall, while Nepal has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/asia/mount-everest-helicopter-insurance-fraud.html" target="_blank">arrested six officials</a> for allegedly running fraudulent helicopter rescue schemes on Mount Everest.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/us-iran-drone-downing.html" target="_blank">U.S. fighter jet</a> shot down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea as it approached an American aircraft carrier, escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran at a delicate moment.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Health officials are warning that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/health/neglected-tropical-diseases-usaid-ntds-river-blindness.html" target="_blank">"biblical diseases"</a> like river blindness could make a comeback across the continent as funding for prevention programs faces potential cuts under the new U.S. administration.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The biggest story coming out of Davos isn't just Trump's trade threats, but the specific framework emerging around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/trump-greenland-deal-framework.html" target="_blank">Greenland talks</a>. We're hearing about potential U.S. sovereign military bases and explicit restrictions on Russian drilling rights. It's a far more concrete proposal than many expected, though <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/denmark-greenland-trump-us-reaction.html" target="_blank">Denmark's pushing back</a> hard on any sovereignty concessions. This isn't just posturing anymore.</p><p>Meanwhile, the broader transatlantic relationship is under serious strain. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/22/us/trump-davos-news" target="_blank">Zelensky's lashing out</a> at European leaders in Davos, telling them they need to step up or risk being left behind as Trump reshapes global alliances. European officials are scrambling to figure out their approach, especially as Trump rolls out his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/middleeast/us-gaza-peace-trump-kushner-davos.html" target="_blank">glittering Gaza plan</a> complete with skyscraper developments. The question isn't whether Trump will disrupt the old order, it's how quickly he'll replace it.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/grok-x-ai-elon-musk-deepfakes.html" target="_blank">Musk's Grok chatbot</a> has flooded X with millions of sexualized AI images in just days, according to new estimates that underscore how quickly these tools can spiral out of control once unleashed.</p><p>• There's a fascinating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/technology/thinking-machines-ai-startup-openai.html" target="_blank">AI startup soap opera</a> riveting Silicon Valley right now, with all the drama you'd expect from an industry where billions are at stake and egos run wild.</p><p>• JPMorgan's <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQbDkzeURHZmQ1eUV5SVF6ZFdCalIwMmc4RGlNZVE2UUFORXJsQ19nUXNNNlF1VUFCVEtJcjJkRDFvdl85UWpnYVREVjhHUTdMbkNVNG51eUpTX1JrWVRtOXgzYTJkQjJ1MHBSWnF" target="_blank">buying UK fintech</a> WealthOS in a deal that shows big banks are still hunting for pension technology, Reuters reports.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's new leadership just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/americas/edmundo-gonzalez-rafael-tudares-detention.html" target="_blank">freed the son-in-law</a> of opposition candidate Edmundo González, a small but significant gesture as the country tries to reset its international relationships.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/europe/putin-board-of-peace-frozen-assets.html" target="_blank">Putin's dangling</a> the possibility that Russia could contribute to Trump's "Board of Peace" if the U.S. unfreezes Russian assets, a typically cynical move that puts the ball back in Washington's court.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/world/asia/indonesia-handprint-rock-art-research.html" target="_blank">67,800-year-old handprint</a> found in Indonesia may be the world's oldest rock art, pushing back the timeline of human artistic expression by tens of thousands of years.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/middleeast/rifaat-al-assad-dead.html" target="_blank">Rifaat al-Assad died</a> at 88, taking with him decades of secrets about Syria's brutal past.

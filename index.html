<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The violence in Minneapolis has escalated dramatically. Representative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/ilhan-omar-town-hall-minnesota.html" target="_blank">Ilhan Omar was attacked</a> at a town hall meeting, adding fuel to already dangerous tensions following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents. The Trump administration is clearly feeling the heat here. A senior aide suggested agents may not have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html" target="_blank">followed protocol</a> in the shooting, while Trump himself is scrambling to contain the political damage. The broader stakes are significant: state legislators across the country are moving to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html" target="_blank">restrict ICE operations</a> in response to the Minneapolis crisis.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump is ramping up pressure on Iran with threats of a "massive armada" and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-iran-armada.html" target="_blank">new demands</a>, telling Tehran that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal. Iran has responded defiantly, saying it will "respond like never before" to U.S. threats. This escalation comes as intelligence briefings reportedly suggest Iran's government is in a weakened state, which may be emboldening Trump's approach. Oil markets are already reacting, with prices hitting four-month highs.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• The Fed is meeting today on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/business/federal-reserve-interest-rates" target="_blank">interest rates</a>, with markets watching closely for signals about monetary policy direction in Trump's second term.</p><p>• Amazon is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">cutting 16,000</a> corporate jobs in its latest round of layoffs, part of a broader wave of tech sector cuts that's heightening worker anxiety across the industry.</p><p>• Snap is doubling down on smart glasses by <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV85cUxQdWlXMHluSDJOQmNRSmxKdVhxMFI0SWlpVFpFb2U0bzM4Y2hhWEVyM2dOU1lWRGVnQlA2dXhhNHEtcUJaNVFPXzdxZ1JueG5CdzdWRWphWjVTNmVEQXh3anRheWlTNVBHbndCTFV" target="_blank">creating a dedicated</a> unit to develop the technology, according to Reuters.</p><p>• Microsoft pledged to save water, but in the AI era it expects <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">usage to soar</a> because of data center demands.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: A Dutch court ordered the Netherlands to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/climate/netherlands-bonaire-climate-ruling.html" target="_blank">protect Bonaire</a> from climate change, marking a significant legal precedent for Caribbean territories facing rising sea levels.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: A Ukrainian train <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">shed its burned cars</a> and kept running after a Russian strike killed five people, highlighting the resilience of Ukraine's rail network despite ongoing attacks.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: An American citizen has gone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html" target="_blank">missing in Kabul</a>, with witnesses saying he was detained by the Taliban, raising fresh concerns about U.S. nationals in Afghanistan.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Iran killed thousands during recent protests, and new reporting reveals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/middleeast/iran-protester-deaths.html" target="_blank">five personal stories</a> behind the government crackdown that helps explain the regime's current vulnerability.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: South Africa is facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">new U.S. scrutiny</a> after conducting naval drills with Iran, complicating Pretoria's foreign policy balancing act in the Trump era.</p>

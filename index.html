<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/ice-funding-congress.html" target="_blank">ICE funding fight</a> on Capitol Hill is getting messy, and it's all tied up with what's happening in Minneapolis. Democrats are pushing to limit what they're calling a "slush fund" that Republicans gave to ICE, which has allowed the agency to ramp up enforcement operations without much congressional oversight. The timing isn't coincidental. After that fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis sparked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota" target="_blank">widespread unrest</a>, Trump's facing his first real crisis of the new term, and it's exposing tensions within his own team about how aggressively to pursue his immigration crackdown.</p><p>The international picture is heating up too, with Iran and the U.S. trading increasingly sharp warnings. Trump's telling Tehran that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5pd459gko" target="_blank">"time is running out"</a> for a nuclear deal while building up military forces in the Gulf, and Iran's Revolutionary Guards are saying they have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/1/28/live-iran-says-it-will-respond-like-never-before-after-trumps-threats" target="_blank">"fingers on the trigger"</a> to respond to any aggression. It's the kind of escalating rhetoric that makes everyone nervous, especially with Trump's track record of backing up threats with action.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">Amazon's cutting</a> about 16,000 corporate jobs in its latest round of layoffs, part of a broader tech industry pullback that's got workers on edge across Silicon Valley and beyond.</li></p>
</ul>
<ul><li>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/business/federal-reserve-interest-rates" target="_blank">Fed held rates</a> steady as expected, with Powell suggesting they'll only cut if the labor market weakens or tariff-driven inflation starts to cool down.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p><ul><li><strong>Latin America:</strong> A Dutch court just ordered the Netherlands to do more to protect the Caribbean island of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/climate/netherlands-bonaire-climate-ruling.html" target="_blank">Bonaire from</a> climate change, in what could be a precedent-setting ruling for island nations facing rising seas.</li></p>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>Europe:</strong> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">Ukrainian train</a> hit by a Russian strike that killed five people literally shed its damaged cars and kept running. It's become a potent symbol of Ukrainian resilience as the war grinds on.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>Asia:</strong> A Chinese dissident who secretly documented the repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/heng-guan-china-uyghurs-asylum.html" target="_blank">won asylum</a> in the U.S., giving Washington a high-profile witness to Beijing's human rights abuses.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Iraq's nominee for prime minister is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/middleeast/trump-iraq-prime-minister-al-maliki.html" target="_blank">rejecting Trump's threats</a> about keeping U.S. bases in the country, setting up another potential confrontation as Trump tries to reshape America's Middle East footprint.</li>

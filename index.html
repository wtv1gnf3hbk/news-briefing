<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news" target="_blank">Davos appearance</a> is dominating global headlines, but not necessarily for the reasons organizers hoped. The president's wide-ranging address touched everything from his designs on Greenland to sharp rebukes of Canada, creating the kind of diplomatic ripples that have become his trademark. What's striking is how quickly his territorial ambitions have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/greenland-ukraine-nato-rutte.html" target="_blank">Europe's "No. 1 Priority"</a> according to NATO leadership, potentially reshaping the alliance's focus just as the Ukraine war continues.</p><p>The broader context here is fascinating. As Europe scrambles to respond to Trump's pressure campaign, we're seeing traditional diplomatic norms get tossed aside in favor of more transactional approaches. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news#trump-greenland-iceland-confusion" target="_blank">Trump's confusion</a> between Greenland and Iceland at one point underscores how these high-stakes territorial discussions can sometimes veer into the surreal. The ripple effects are already visible in markets, where energy stocks are surging on geopolitical uncertainty, according to Bloomberg.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/business/davos-trump.html" target="_blank">Big Tech's role</a> at Davos is getting scrutinized as CEOs navigate Trump's unpredictable policy agenda and try to position themselves for whatever comes next in Washington.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/uber-scrutiny-sexual-assault.html" target="_blank">Uber's facing</a> renewed pressure over its sexual assault record, with regulators and advocacy groups pushing for stronger safety measures across the ride-sharing industry.</p><p>• An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html" target="_blank">AI startup</a> is making the case that it wants to empower workers rather than replace them, a pitch that's becoming more common as the industry tries to calm public anxiety about job displacement.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/snap-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">Snap settled</a> a major social media addiction lawsuit just ahead of what would have been a landmark trial, avoiding a precedent that could have reshaped how platforms handle user safety.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America:</strong> Most Latin Americans actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html" target="_blank">support Trump's</a> proposed military intervention in Venezuela, according to new polling data. It's a striking sign of how unpopular Maduro's regime has become across the region.</p><p>• <strong>Europe:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/prince-harry-emotional-court-daily-mail.html" target="_blank">Prince Harry</a> gave emotional testimony about how media coverage has affected his life, as his legal battle with the Daily Mail continues to expose the darker side of Britain's tabloid culture.</p><p>• <strong>Asia:</strong> Japan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/japan-nuclear-restart.html" target="_blank">restarted operations</a> at the world's biggest nuclear plant despite public anxiety, as the country tries to balance energy security with safety concerns more than a decade after Fukushima.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/middleeast/israeli-strikes-in-gaza-kill-11-including-three-journalists.html" target="_blank">Israeli strikes</a> in Gaza killed 11 people including three journalists, highlighting how the conflict continues to exact a heavy toll on media workers trying to cover the story.</p><p>• <strong>Africa:</strong> Church leaders and police say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html" target="_blank">over 160 people</a> were kidnapped in Nigeria, part of an ongoing security crisis that's become a major challenge for the government in Abuja.</p>

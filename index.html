<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Pakistan launched deadly strikes on Afghanistan overnight, marking a dangerous escalation in cross-border tensions. According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/22/pakistan-carries-out-strikes-in-afghanistan-after-islamabad-suicide-attack" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>, Pakistan says the attacks were retaliation for recent suicide bombings, but Afghanistan is promising an "appropriate response."

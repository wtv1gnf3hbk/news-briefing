<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Trump administration's immigration crackdown is facing its first major legal challenge as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/ice-director-minnesota-contempt.html" target="_blank">federal judge</a> ordered ICE's director to appear in court over potential contempt charges. This stems from enforcement actions in Minnesota that have sparked nationwide protests and put Republicans in an unexpected defensive position on immigration policy. The political calculus is shifting fast. Even some Trump supporters are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/ileana-garcia-trump-immigration-crackdown.html" target="_blank">sounding alarms</a> that the aggressive approach could cost the GOP in the midterms.</p><p>The fallout extends beyond politics into America's demographic future. New Census data shows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/census-2025-estimates-population-immigration.html" target="_blank">population growth</a> has slowed sharply as immigration numbers plunge, raising questions about economic competitiveness. States like Texas are doubling down, moving to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/texas-immigrants-h1b-visas.html" target="_blank">curtail H1-B visas</a> for skilled workers. It's a remarkable political reversal that has the party of business <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/minnesota-politics-immigration-trump.html" target="_blank">playing defense</a> on economic growth arguments.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/trump-says-he-s-not-concerned-with-decline-of-us-dollar" target="_blank">dollar tumbled</a> in its biggest one-day drop since April after Trump said he wasn't concerned about the currency's decline, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>• Social media companies are heading into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/social-media-addiction-trial.html" target="_blank">landmark trials</a> over child safety, with cases that could reshape how platforms operate and what liability they face.</p><p>• Microsoft's promising to save water while simultaneously expecting usage to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">soar dramatically</a> because of AI data centers. It's the kind of contradiction that defines the AI boom's environmental impact.</p><p>• Government debt in the world's richest nations is hitting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/business/economy/government-debt-bonds.html" target="_blank">record levels</a>, threatening global growth as borrowing costs climb and fiscal space shrinks.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Families from Trinidad and Tobago filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html" target="_blank">wrongful death lawsuit</a> against the Trump administration over a U.S. military boat strike off Venezuela's coast that killed two people.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Spain is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/europe/spain-undocumented-migrants-residency.html" target="_blank">bucking global trends</a> by offering undocumented migrants a legal pathway to residency, just as other countries tighten immigration policies. Meanwhile, a new study finds troop casualties in the Ukraine war are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/russia-ukraine-casualties.html" target="_blank">nearing 2 million</a>.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Trump's threatening <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/world/asia/korea-trump-higher-tariff.html" target="_blank">higher tariffs</a> on South Korea just months after the countries struck a trade deal, rattling Seoul and highlighting how fragile trade relationships have become under his administration.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: U.S. intelligence is telling Trump that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/trump-reports-iran-government.html" target="_blank">Iran's government</a> is weaker than previously assessed, the BBC reports, even as Tehran and its allies are ramping up retaliation threats against approaching American warships.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A South African court ruled that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela memorabilia</a> can proceed to auction despite family objections, ending a legal battle over the anti-apartheid leader's personal items.</p>

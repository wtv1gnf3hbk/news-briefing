<p>Good morning Adam. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The big story today is Trump ramping up his confrontation with Europe as he heads to Davos, with his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/europe/davos-trump-europe.html" target="_blank">Greenland threats</a> now triggering serious pushback from European leaders and market jitters. What started as seemingly outlandish territorial ambitions is now looking more like a calculated pressure campaign that's putting real strain on transatlantic relations. European officials are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news" target="_blank">pushing back</a> hard, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas questioning Trump's trustworthiness, per the BBC.</p><p>The market reaction tells you how seriously investors are taking this. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news#stocks-trump-greenland-tariffs" target="_blank">U.S. stocks</a> tumbled yesterday on renewed tariff fears, and volatility gauges are jumping as Trump's threats spook investors, per Reuters. Meanwhile, Canada's prime minister is calling this a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/20/us/trump-news#carney-davos-speech-world-economic-forum" target="_blank">"rupture"</a> in the world order at Davos. It's shaping up to be a defining moment for how Trump's second term will reshape global relationships - and whether his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/us/politics/trump-oval-office-world-leaders.html" target="_blank">use of power</a> on the world stage will bring results or chaos.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p>

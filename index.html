<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The crisis in Minneapolis is reshaping immigration politics across the country, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html" target="_blank">legislators move</a> to restrict ICE operations in their states following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti during an immigration raid. What started as a local tragedy has become a full-blown test of federal versus state authority, with Stephen Miller now suggesting federal agents may have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html" target="_blank">diverted from protocol</a> in the shooting. The political fallout briefly put Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/noem-trump-minnesota-shooting-fallout.html" target="_blank">Trump's penalty box</a>, though she's apparently back in favor.</p><p>The broader stakes here go well beyond one incident. Trump's immigration crackdown was supposed to be his signature early victory, but Minneapolis has become a symbol of resistance that's energizing Democratic governors and state legislators nationwide. The administration clearly recognizes they have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-minnesota-noem-bovino-homan-miller.html" target="_blank">a big problem</a> on their hands. Meanwhile, Jerome Powell and the Fed are meeting at what's being called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/economy/fed-trump-powell-interest-rates.html" target="_blank">a pivotal moment</a> for the central bank's independence, as Trump continues pressuring for rate cuts.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">Amazon's cutting</a> about 16,000 corporate jobs in its latest round of layoffs, signaling the tech giant is still trying to right-size after its pandemic hiring spree.</p><p>• Microsoft's facing an awkward contradiction: it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">pledged to save</a> water, but now expects its usage to soar because of AI data centers. The environmental costs of the AI boom are getting harder to ignore.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/social-media-addiction-trial.html" target="_blank">Social media giants</a> are facing landmark legal tests on child safety that could reshape how platforms operate if courts find them liable for addiction among minors.</p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/media/sundance-film-festival-park-city-boulder.html" target="_blank">Sundance Film Festival</a> is saying goodbye to Park City after decades, moving to Boulder in a shift that says something about changing economics in the film world.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Trinidadian families have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit</a> over a boat strike by the U.S. military, highlighting tensions as Washington ramps up Caribbean operations under Trump's immigration crackdown.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: A Russian strike killed five people, but Ukraine's railway kept running after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">train cars burned</a>. It's a small but telling symbol of Ukrainian resilience as the war grinds on into its third year.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: There's a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html" target="_blank">missing American citizen</a> in Kabul that witnesses say was held by the Taliban. It's another reminder of how precarious things remain for Americans in Afghanistan.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Trump's been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/trump-reports-iran-government.html" target="_blank">briefed on intelligence</a> suggesting Iran's government is weaker than it appears, which could explain his increasingly aggressive posture toward Tehran. The BBC notes he's warning that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5pd459gko" target="_blank">"time is running out"</a> for a nuclear deal.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: South Africa is facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">new U.S. scrutiny</a> after conducting naval drills with Iran. It's exactly the kind of partnership that's going to draw Trump's ire as he takes a harder line globally.</p>

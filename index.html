<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Trump administration is facing its first real domestic crisis as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html" target="_blank">Minneapolis rages</a> over the ICE shooting of Alex Pretti. What started as an immigration enforcement operation has spiraled into something much bigger. State legislators across the country are now moving to restrict ICE operations in their jurisdictions, creating a direct confrontation between federal immigration policy and state authority. Stephen Miller's suggestion that federal agents may have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/stephen-miller-alex-pretti-shooting.html" target="_blank">diverted from protocol</a> during the shooting is a rare admission that something went wrong.</p><p>The political fallout is already reshaping the administration's inner circle. Kristi Noem found herself briefly in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/noem-trump-minnesota-shooting-fallout.html" target="_blank">Trump's penalty box</a> over her handling of the crisis, while Corey Lewandowski has emerged as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-noem-trump.html" target="_blank">familiar figure</a> at the center of the uproar. The administration clearly recognized it had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/trump-minnesota-noem-bovino-homan-miller.html" target="_blank">big problem</a> on its hands. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve meets today at what could be a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/economy/fed-trump-powell-interest-rates.html" target="_blank">pivotal moment</a> for the central bank's independence as Trump continues his public pressure campaign.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Amazon's announcing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">16,000 layoffs</a> in its latest round of corporate cuts, signaling that even tech giants aren't immune to economic pressures this year.</p><p>• The UK is pushing Google to let websites <a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPMmszZEtneFZvYmhQQnhYYl9JbDBVNlhsWU5CY1ZuRUZ0cHQxVjRCc2RyLVhFeVpOTDczZnkzcng4RXFUQkRFNUNxa3h0TkFMLTN3ZU9QZWx2MVBRWnpaelJuVktsRFJqdVJ2cDl0Q2FkdUZZWHRrbE9ULXVIUHJ1aEFrQU5BQ3lHMUdYVUtqZi1LVDN1dHdMQjZtSnJiVWZrRkFGQVd1ZHF3Mm8?oc=5" target="_blank">opt out</a> of AI Overviews, according to Reuters. It's part of a broader regulatory pushback against how AI companies are using online content without permission.</p><p>• Microsoft's water usage is expected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">soar dramatically</a> because of AI operations, despite the company's previous pledges to conserve water. Those data centers are thirstier than anyone anticipated.</p><p>• Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cooled speculation about dollar intervention, saying the US <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/bessent-cools-yen-intervention-speculation-touts-strong-dollar" target="_blank">hasn't intervened</a> to weaken the currency against the yen, Bloomberg reports.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Trinidadian families have filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html" target="_blank">wrongful death lawsuit</a> against the U.S. military over a boat strike incident. It's adding tension to Washington's relationships in the Caribbean at a time when the region is already wary of American military operations.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: A Russian missile strike killed five people and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">burned train cars</a> in Ukraine, but the railway kept running anyway. It's a small symbol of how Ukraine's infrastructure keeps functioning even under constant attack.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: A veteran Indian politician was among five people killed in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/india-plane-crash.html" target="_blank">plane crash</a> there, while witnesses say an American citizen has gone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html" target="_blank">missing in Kabul</a> and may be held by the Taliban.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Trump's been briefed on intelligence suggesting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/trump-reports-iran-government.html" target="_blank">Iran's government</a> is weaker than it appears, which could explain his increasingly aggressive rhetoric. He's threatening Iran again while also calling for nuclear negotiations.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: South Africa is facing fresh scrutiny from Washington after conducting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">naval drills</a> with Iran. It's exactly the kind of partnership that's going to complicate U.S.-Africa relations under Trump's more transactional approach.</p>

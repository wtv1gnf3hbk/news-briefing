<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The White House is scrambling to distance itself from Trump's initial response to the fatal shooting of a nurse by immigration officers in Minneapolis, as the incident becomes a defining moment for the administration's enforcement approach. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/26/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice" target="_blank">shooting has sparked</a> widespread protests and unrest, while Democrats are seizing on what they wanted to avoid. They're now embracing a potential government shutdown fight over ICE funding, turning the Minneapolis crisis into their line in the sand.</p><p>Meanwhile, a massive winter storm is battering the country, disrupting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/storm-flight-cancellations-delays.html" target="_blank">thousands of flights</a> and leaving communities across multiple states dealing with dangerous conditions. The storm has already claimed at least a dozen lives and is testing infrastructure from coast to coast. It's also providing an unfortunate backdrop to the Minneapolis crisis, as emergency resources are stretched thin nationwide.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Silicon Valley executives are finding themselves in an awkward spot, trying to maintain their courtship of Trump while their own employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/technology/ice-minnesota-protests-tech.html" target="_blank">seethe over</a> the Minneapolis shootings. The tech industry's cozy relationship with the administration is getting a stress test.</p><p>• Bridgewater's co-CIOs are warning that the AI spending frenzy could fundamentally reshape the entire economy, according to Reuters. They're seeing investment patterns that go way beyond typical tech cycles.</p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/business/european-union-x-grok-ai-images-musk.html" target="_blank">EU is investigating</a> Elon Musk's X over sexualized AI images generated by its Grok chatbot. It's another regulatory headache for Musk's social media platform.</p><p>• The Washington Post has quietly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/business/media/washington-post-winter-olympics.html" target="_blank">scrapped plans</a> to cover the upcoming Winter Olympics, a sign of how much the media industry is cutting back on expensive international coverage.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Venezuela's government is allowing more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-economy-rodriguez.html" target="_blank">economic freedom</a> while keeping everything else locked down tight. It's a fascinating experiment in selective liberalization under authoritarian rule.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: NATO's chief delivered a blunt wake-up call, saying Europe is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/europe/nato-chief-europe-greenland-trump-us.html" target="_blank">absolutely dreaming</a> if it thinks it can defend itself without U.S. help. The comments come as Trump's Greenland talk has everyone on edge about American commitments.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Japanese panda fans are saying goodbye to their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/japan-pandas-china.html" target="_blank">furry ambassadors</a> as China recalls the beloved animals. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping showed that even top generals aren't safe from his purges, with news that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/asia/china-xi-zhang-youxia-military.html" target="_blank">another military leader</a> has fallen from grace.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Intelligence briefings are telling Trump that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/trump-reports-iran-government.html" target="_blank">Iran's government</a> is weaker than it appears, even as U.S. warships move closer to the Gulf and Tehran ramps up retaliation threats. Israel says it's recovered the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/world/middleeast/gaza-hostage-returned-israel.html" target="_blank">remains of</a> the last Gaza hostage, closing a painful chapter.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: A South African court has ruled that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/world/africa/nelson-mandela-memorabilia-auction.html" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela memorabilia</a> can go to auction, ending a legal battle over the anti-apartheid leader's personal items. The decision has stirred debate about preserving historical artifacts versus family rights.</p>

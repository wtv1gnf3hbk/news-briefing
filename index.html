<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>The Trump administration's immigration crackdown is hitting hard in Minneapolis, where children are experiencing what our team calls a "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/minneapolis-children-ice-schools.html" target="_blank">winter of fear</a>" as ICE operations tear through their communities. Kids are having nightmares, friends are disappearing from school, and the psychological toll is mounting. This comes as Trump's border czar announced plans to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/04/us/trump-news" target="_blank">pull 700</a> immigration agents from Minnesota, part of a broader reshuffling that's left local police chiefs struggling to maintain community trust they've spent years building.</p><p>The broader political picture shows Trump continuing to push boundaries on federal power. He's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/trump-save-act-elections.html" target="_blank">repeating calls</a> to "nationalize" elections, even as his own White House walks back the comments, and his administration has thrown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/trump-changing-course-throws-harvard-deal-talks-into-chaos.html" target="_blank">Harvard deal talks</a> into chaos with another policy reversal. It's a pattern that historians are calling "neoroyalism," reflecting how Trump's governing style echoes monarchical approaches to executive power.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/jeffrey-epstein-trust-inherit-karyna-shuliak.html" target="_blank">Epstein files</a> keep revealing new details, this time about who stands to inherit his fortune through a trust structure that's finally been made public.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html" target="_blank">Musk merged</a> SpaceX with his AI startup xAI, creating a massive space-tech conglomerate that could reshape both industries.</p><p>• Netflix's leadership is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/business/media/netflix-sarandos-warner-senate-hearing.html" target="_blank">pushing hard</a> for its Warner Bros. acquisition in front of skeptical senators who worry about media consolidation.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/match-beats-on-quarterly-revenue-earnings-in-sign-of-turnaround" target="_blank">Match Group surged</a> after earnings that suggest its turnaround strategy is finally working, according to Bloomberg.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/americas/venezuela-rodriguez-maduro-authoritarian.html" target="_blank">Venezuela's authoritarian grip</a> appears to be loosening slightly, but analysts are questioning how long any reforms will last under Maduro's government.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/europe/15-dead-migrant-clash-collision-greece.html" target="_blank">15 migrants died</a> in a rare collision between a migrant boat and Greek patrol vessel, highlighting the ongoing dangers in the Mediterranean crossing.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Beijing detained <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/asia/china-journalists-liu-hu-detained.html" target="_blank">two Chinese journalists</a> who were reporting on corruption, part of Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on press freedom.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/emirates-saudi-arabia-rift.html" target="_blank">UAE and Saudi Arabia</a> are openly clashing despite both being Trump's closest Arab allies, creating new complications for Gulf diplomacy.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Health officials are warning that "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/health/neglected-tropical-diseases-usaid-ntds-river-blindness.html" target="_blank">biblical diseases</a>" like river blindness could resurge across the continent due to funding cuts to neglected tropical disease programs.</p>

Canada's making some bold moves on the global stage - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/canada/carney-speech-davos-trump.html" target="_blank">Mark Carney spoke</a> at Davos yesterday with what sounds like a pretty direct message about Canada's place in the world, even as Trump's territorial ambitions loom large. Speaking of which, Trump's finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news" target="_blank">heading to Davos</a> after an electrical issue delayed his departure, and his Greenland obsession is creating some serious headaches for NATO allies.</p><p>The Davos drama isn't just symbolic - it's reflecting real fractures in the transatlantic relationship that could reshape everything from trade to security cooperation. Meanwhile, back in Washington, the Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-fed-cook.html" target="_blank">fire Fed officials</a> at will, which would be a pretty massive shift in how monetary policy works. All of this is happening while his EPA has literally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/climate/epa-human-life-value.html" target="_blank">valued human life</a> at zero dollars in new regulatory calculations - a stark signal about where environmental policy is headed.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• Netflix is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/business/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-takeover.html" target="_blank">revamping its bid</a> for Warner Bros.

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-davos-speech-takeaways.html" target="_blank">Davos appearance</a> yesterday created the kind of global stir we've come to expect, but with a twist that matters for international relations. He floated what he called a "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/21/us/trump-davos-greenland-news" target="_blank">Greenland framework</a>" for some kind of future deal, stepping back from his earlier tariff threats against Europe. NATO allies are now quietly discussing U.S. sovereignty over bases there, which represents a significant shift in how they're responding to Trump's territorial ambitions.</p><p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump's attempt to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-fed-cook.html" target="_blank">fire Fed</a> Governor Michelle Cook, with justices seeming skeptical of executive power over central bank independence. It's an early test of how far Trump can push institutional boundaries, and the court's eventual ruling could define the Fed's autonomy for decades. Meanwhile, ICE operations are ramping up nationwide, creating the kind of federal-local tensions that defined Trump's first term.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• A federal judge blocked the government from reviewing devices seized from Washington Post reporters, handing the paper a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/media/washington-post-reporter-search-first-amendment.html" target="_blank">First Amendment</a> victory that could set important precedent for press protections under Trump.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/business/uber-scrutiny-sexual-assault.html" target="_blank">Uber's facing</a> renewed pressure over its sexual assault record as lawmakers push for stronger oversight of ride-sharing safety protocols.</p><p>• Snap settled a major social media addiction lawsuit just before what would have been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/snap-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">landmark trial</a> that could have reshaped how we think about platform liability.</p><p>• The FTC is appealing its loss in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/ftc-meta-antitrust-appeal.html" target="_blank">Meta antitrust</a> case, keeping alive one of the biggest tech monopoly fights of the decade.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Most Latin Americans actually support Trump's recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/americas/latin-america-venezuela-us-raid-maduro-polls.html" target="_blank">Venezuela raid</a>, according to new polling that shows how unpopular Maduro's regime has become across the region.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Prince Harry gave emotional testimony about how tabloid coverage affected his life, the latest chapter in his ongoing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/europe/prince-harry-emotional-court-daily-mail.html" target="_blank">court battle</a> against the Daily Mail.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: South Korea's former prime minister got <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/asia/south-korea-prime-minister-martial-law.html" target="_blank">23 years</a> in prison for his role in the martial law crisis, showing how seriously Seoul is taking accountability for that constitutional mess.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Rifaat al-Assad, the "Butcher of Hama" who led some of the Syrian regime's worst massacres, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/world/middleeast/rifaat-al-assad-dead.html" target="_blank">died at</a> 88, closing a dark chapter just as Syria tries to rebuild.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: Church leaders and police report that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/africa/nigeria-christian-church-kidnapping.html" target="_blank">over 160</a> people were kidnapped in Nigeria, highlighting the ongoing security crisis plaguing the country's northern regions.</p>

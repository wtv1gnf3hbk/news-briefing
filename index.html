<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>We're leading today with a deeply reported look at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/middleeast/iran-protester-deaths.html" target="_blank">Iran's brutal crackdown</a> on protesters over recent years. The investigation puts human faces on what intelligence estimates suggest were thousands of deaths during various waves of unrest. It's particularly timely given the escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>Speaking of which, Trump's ramping up pressure on Iran in a big way. He's warning that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/trump-news" target="_blank">"time is running out"</a> for a nuclear deal while moving what he calls a "massive armada" toward the Persian Gulf. Iran's responding with threats to retaliate "like never before," setting up what could be the most serious U.S.-Iran crisis in years. It's classic Trump brinkmanship, but with real stakes for regional stability.</p><p>The domestic picture remains dominated by the fallout from Minneapolis, where federal immigration enforcement has triggered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/28/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice-minnesota" target="_blank">a political crisis</a> that's now reaching state legislatures nationwide. Even Trump's own team seems to be acknowledging something went wrong with the protocols that led to Alex Pretti's death.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p>

<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/technology/amazon-corporate-layoffs.html" target="_blank">Amazon's cutting</a> another 16,000 corporate jobs in what's becoming a sustained downsizing of its white-collar workforce</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/microsoft-water-ai-data-centers.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's acknowledging</a> that its AI ambitions will massively increase water consumption, despite previous environmental pledges</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/media/sundance-film-festival-park-city-boulder.html" target="_blank">Sundance is leaving</a> Park City after decades, moving to Boulder in a shift that says a lot about changing economics in the film world</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Latin America:</strong> Families in Trinidad are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/us/politics/trinidad-wrongful-death-lawsuit-boat-strike.html" target="_blank">suing the U.S. military</a> over a boat strike that killed civilians, adding another complication to regional relations as Trump ramps up military operations</p>
<p>• <strong>Europe:</strong> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/europe/ukraine-train-attack.html" target="_blank">Russian drone strike</a> killed five people on a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine, showing how the war continues to target civilian infrastructure</p>
<p>• <strong>Asia:</strong> There's growing concern about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/asia/us-citizen-missing-afghanistan-taliban.html" target="_blank">a missing American citizen</a> in Kabul whom witnesses say was detained by the Taliban, testing the fragile relationship between Washington and Afghanistan's rulers</p>
<p>• <strong>Middle East:</strong> Iraq's likely next prime minister is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/middleeast/trump-iraq-prime-minister-al-maliki.html" target="_blank">rejecting Trump's threats</a> about potential military action, signaling Baghdad won't be easily pressured despite U.S. influence</p>
<p>• <strong>Africa:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/world/africa/south-africa-iran-navy-drills-trump.html" target="_blank">South Africa's facing</a> new scrutiny from Washington after conducting naval exercises with Iran, as Trump's team reassesses relationships with countries seen as too cozy with Tehran</p>

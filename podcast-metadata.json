  "script": "Right then, here's what's happening in the world today.\n\nSo Trump's immigration crackdown is hitting some proper resistance, especially up in Minnesota where his border czar Tom Homan's trying to sort out the mess after ICE operations sparked massive protests. Federal courts are pushing back hard against the mass deportation plans, and get this - Trump's actually reached out to Chuck Schumer about cutting some kind of deal. That tells you the political backlash might be stronger than they expected.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI's hunting for another absolutely massive funding round that could hit a hundred billion dollars, which is wild even by Silicon Valley standards. And there's this new \"Sell America\" trend on Wall Street where traders are betting against the dollar because of all the uncertainty Trump's policies are creating.\n\nOver in Costa Rica, there's an election happening with a right-wing populist leading by quite a lot, which would be a big shift for a country that's usually pretty centrist. And Russia just killed twelve miners in a strike on Ukraine's energy infrastructure whilst peace talks got delayed after the US and Russia met directly.\n\nThat's your world update for today. I'm Alice, catch you next time.",

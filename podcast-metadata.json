Here's the state of play:\n\nWashington is wrestling with a Homeland Security funding crisis that could disrupt TSA operations and other critical security functions. The standoff reflects broader tensions over immigration enforcement and border security priorities. Meanwhile, the administration is facing pushback on multiple fronts, from student protests against ICE operations to questions about secret deportations that allegedly bypassed legal protections.\n\nThe domestic political landscape is getting more contentious as Trump's influence continues to reshape Republican messaging around elections and voter access. The broader implications of this shift are playing out in state-level battles over election security measures that critics say could restrict voting rights.\n\nBusiness/Tech\n\n• Homeland Security is demanding access to social media accounts that organize anti-ICE activities, raising questions about surveillance overreach and First Amendment protections.\n\n• AI personalization is reshaping your internet experience without your input, as tech giants roll out algorithms that curate content based on behavioral data you can't easily control.\n\n• Iran is deploying digital tools including facial recognition technology to track down protesters, part of a broader crackdown on dissent that's become increasingly tech-enabled.\n\n• Corporate earnings calls are dominated by AI concerns as investors worry about which industries will be disrupted next, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAround the World\n\n• Latin America: Brazil is exploring polyamory in ways that would have been unthinkable in this heavily Catholic country just a decade ago, reflecting shifting social attitudes across the region.\n\n• Europe: The BBC reports that Iran is ready to discuss nuclear compromises, with Tehran's deputy foreign minister telling the BBC that \"the ball is in America's court\" to prove they want a deal.\n\n• Asia: An Islamist party's growing influence is overshadowing student revolutionaries in Bangladesh, creating tension between the youth movement that drove recent changes and religious conservatives gaining political ground.\n\n• Middle East: The death of an Iranian protester in custody has sparked outrage, with his family convinced he was executed rather than dying from natural causes as authorities claim.\n\n• Africa: A peace activist in South Sudan has been caught plotting a coup, highlighting the complex dynamics in a country where the line between political opposition and armed resistance remains blurred.\n\nThat's your world update for today.",

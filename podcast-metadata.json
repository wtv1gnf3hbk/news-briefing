Here's the state of play:\n\nThe Jeffrey Epstein files are sending shockwaves through Washington and beyond today. A former police chief says Trump told him back in 2006 that \"everyone\" knew about Epstein's behavior when Florida authorities were investigating the financier. The revelations don't stop there.

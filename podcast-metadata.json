  "script": "Right then, here's what's happening in the world today.\n\nGood morning. Here's the state of play:\n\nThe Trump administration's immigration crackdown is hitting hard in Minneapolis, where children are experiencing what our team calls a \"winter of fear\" as ICE operations tear through their communities. Kids are having nightmares, friends are disappearing from school, and the psychological toll is mounting. This comes as Trump's border czar announced plans to pull 700 immigration agents from Minnesota, part of a broader reshuffling that's left local police chiefs struggling to maintain community trust they've spent years building.\n\nThe broader political picture shows Trump continuing to push boundaries on federal power. He's repeating calls to \"nationalize\" elections, even as his own White House walks back the comments, and his administration has thrown Harvard deal talks into chaos with another policy reversal. It's a pattern that historians are calling \"neoroyalism,\" reflecting how Trump's governing style echoes monarchical approaches to executive power.\n\nBusiness/Tech\n\n• The Epstein files keep revealing new details, this time about who stands to inherit his fortune through a trust structure that's finally been made public.\n\n• Musk merged SpaceX with his AI startup xAI, creating a massive space-tech conglomerate that could reshape both industries.\n\n• Netflix's leadership is pushing hard for its Warner Bros. acquisition in front of skeptical senators who worry about media consolidation.\n\n• Match Group surged after earnings that suggest its turnaround strategy is finally working, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAround the World\n\n• Latin America: Venezuela's authoritarian grip appears to be loosening slightly, but analysts are questioning how long any reforms will last under Maduro's government.\n\n• Europe: At least 15 migrants died in a rare collision between a migrant boat and Greek patrol vessel, highlighting the ongoing dangers in the Mediterranean crossing.\n\n• Asia: Beijing detained two Chinese journalists who were reporting on corruption, part of Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on press freedom.\n\n• Middle East: The UAE and Saudi Arabia are openly clashing despite both being Trump's closest Arab allies, creating new complications for Gulf diplomacy.\n\n• Africa: Health officials are warning that \"biblical diseases\" like river blindness could resurge across the continent due to funding cuts to neglected tropical disease programs.\n\nThat's your world update for today.",

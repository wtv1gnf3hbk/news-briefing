# Explanify: Seoul Presentation Framework

## Based on the Explanatory Playbook

### Core Principles
1. **Start with what people think they know** — then complicate it
2. **One idea per slide** — if it needs a comma, it needs two slides
3. **Concrete before abstract** — examples first, frameworks second
4. **Stakes before mechanics** — why it matters before how it works
5. **End with what's unresolved** — leave them thinking

## Presentation Structure

### Act 1: The Setup (5-7 min)

**Slide 1: The Deceptively Simple Question**
- Start with a question the audience thinks they can answer
- Example: "How do you know what's happening in the world?"
- Let them sit with the false confidence

**Slide 2: The Complication**
- Reveal why the simple answer is insufficient
- Data point or anecdote that disrupts assumptions
- "The average person encounters 300+ headlines daily. They remember 3."

**Slide 3: The Stakes**
- Why does this matter? Make it visceral.
- Connect to their lives, not abstract concepts
- "Misinformation doesn't happen TO people. It happens THROUGH people."

### Act 2: The Framework (10-12 min)

**Slide 4-6: The Key Insight**
- One core idea, unpacked across three slides
- Slide 4: The observation
- Slide 5: The evidence
- Slide 6: The implication

**Slide 7-9: The Second Insight**
- Build on the first
- Show how the ideas connect
- Use callback references ("Remember when I said...")

**Slide 10: The Synthesis**
- Bring the threads together
- This is where your framework crystallizes
- Should feel inevitable, not forced

### Act 3: The Application (5-7 min)

**Slide 11: What This Looks Like**
- Concrete example of the framework in action
- Show, don't tell
- Real artifact if possible (screenshot, document, etc.)

**Slide 12: What You Can Do**
- Actionable takeaway
- One thing they can try tomorrow
- Make it specific and achievable

**Slide 13: The Unresolved Question**
- Don't wrap it up too neatly
- Leave them with something to wrestle with
- "The question isn't whether AI will change journalism. It's whether journalists will shape how."

## Visual Guidelines

### Typography
- **Titles**: Bold, short (3-5 words max)
- **Body**: One sentence per slide, or a single number/stat
- **Never**: Bullet points, paragraphs, or multiple ideas

### Imagery
- Full-bleed photos over clip art
- Screenshots of real interfaces
- Data viz should be legible from the back row

### Color
- High contrast (works in any lighting)
- Consistent palette throughout
- Use color sparingly — for emphasis only

## Seoul-Specific Content Ideas

### Potential Themes
1. **The Global Information Ecosystem** — How news flows across borders
2. **AI in Journalism** — Tools, threats, and transformations
3. **Explanatory Journalism** — Making complexity accessible
4. **Newsletter Renaissance** — Why email is having a moment
5. **Trust and Verification** — Building credibility in a skeptical age

### Local Connections
- Reference Korean media landscape where relevant
- Acknowledge K-media's global influence (K-drama, K-pop cultural journalism)
- Be aware of regional tensions when discussing geopolitics

### Q&A Prep
Anticipate questions about:
- AI replacing journalists
- Paywalls and access
- American media perspective vs. global
- How NYT covers Asia (self-aware about blind spots)

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Confirm topic/theme for Seoul
2. [ ] Gather 3-5 key examples/artifacts
3. [ ] Draft slide-by-slide outline
4. [ ] First visual pass (structure before polish)
5. [ ] Rehearse with timer (aim for 20-25 min)
6. [ ] Prepare 5 potential Q&A responses

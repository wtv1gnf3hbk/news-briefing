Run the briefing evaluation system against the current briefing.md.

Run `node evaluate-briefing.js` and show the results. Summarize:
- Which structural checks passed/failed
- Which source integrity checks passed/failed
- The LLM judge scores (if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set)
- Overall pass/fail

If there are failures, briefly explain what each one means and how to fix it.

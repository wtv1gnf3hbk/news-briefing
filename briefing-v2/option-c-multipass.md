Good morning. Here is the state of play:

The last major US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty expired overnight, leaving the world's two largest nuclear arsenals without formal limits for the first time in decades. The [New START pact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires) had capped deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 per side since 2011, and neither Washington nor Moscow has signaled any urgency about a replacement. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping used a phone call with Trump to [press on Taiwan](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html), warning the US not to cross Beijing's red lines on the island. The call came as Trump defended his confrontational, unpredictable approach to [deals and diplomacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html), arguing the chaos gives him leverage even as allies struggle to keep up.

In Nigeria, gunmen killed [over 160 people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) in an attack in the country's west, one of the deadliest episodes of violence there in years. The Guardian and BBC both led with the story, and the Red Cross confirmed casualties at multiple sites. Separately, a [hospital airstrike](https://www.aljazeera.com/) in South Sudan drew international condemnation, with Al Jazeera leading its coverage on the attack.

Back in Washington, the chairman of elite law firm Paul Weiss [resigned over ties](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html) to Jeffrey Epstein, and the Washington Post announced it is [cutting 300+ jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html) in a major restructuring. Trump also moved to [block wind/solar](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) projects on federal land.

**Business & Tech**

- A global [tech selloff deepened](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/asian-stocks-to-fall-as-tech-led-drop-gains-pace-markets-wrap) for a second day, dragging Asian and European markets lower. Bitcoin tumbled toward $70K as risk appetite evaporated across the board.
- Elon Musk's empire could get even bigger: SpaceX and xAI are exploring a [possible merger](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html) that would combine his rocket company with his AI startup.

> Good morning. Here's the state of play:
>
> More than 160 people have been killed by gunmen in [attacks across Nigeria](https://www.theguardian.com/uk), one of the deadliest waves of violence the country has seen in years. That is leading headlines across London and other international outlets this morning, and the scale is staggering. At the same time, a pillar of global nuclear security has quietly collapsed: the last major arms control treaty between the US and Russia has [officially expired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires), leaving the world's two largest nuclear arsenals without any formal framework of limits or inspections for the first time in decades. That is genuinely dangerous, and it is happening at a moment when Washington and Moscow can barely speak to each other.
>
> On the US-China front, Xi Jinping used a [phone call](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html) with Donald Trump to deliver a pointed message on Taiwan: be prudent about arms sales. Trump, meanwhile, is defending his unpredictable negotiating style in a new [NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html), arguing that keeping allies and adversaries guessing gives him leverage. But the costs are adding up. His administration is effectively [blocking hundreds](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) of wind and solar projects across the country, and the Epstein fallout keeps claiming powerful figures: Brad Karp, chairman of elite law firm Paul Weiss, has [stepped down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html) over the firm's ties to Jeffrey Epstein.
>
> **Business/Tech**
>
> - The Washington Post is [cutting over 300](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html) journalists, one of the largest single rounds of newsroom layoffs in memory. A brutal blow to one of America's most storied papers.
> - Google has gone from AI laggard to leader, posting [stellar growth](https://www.reuters.com/) numbers that suggest its AI investments are finally paying off.
> - Global tech stocks are sliding further into a [broad selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/), Bitcoin is slumping toward $70,000, and silver is plunging. Not a fun morning for anyone holding risk assets.
> - SpaceX and xAI, Elon Musk's AI venture, are [set to merge](https://www.bloomberg.com/), further consolidating his sprawling tech empire.
>
> **Around the World**
>
> - **Latin America:** Venezuela has [detained allies](https://www.reuters.com/) of Nicolas Maduro who had been targeted by US sanctions, a sign of deepening fractures inside the regime.
> - **Europe:** France has [raided X's offices](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) as regulators turn up the heat on the platform, Cortina's Winter Olympics preparations are in chaos, and Spain has banned social media for kids under 16.
> - **Asia:** Aid cuts to Afghanistan are [causing hunger](https://www.reuters.com/) and death on a devastating scale, and two Chinese journalists have been detained in a fresh crackdown on press freedom.
> - **Middle East:** The US and Iran are set to hold [talks in Oman](https://www.aljazeera.com/) on Friday, a potentially significant diplomatic opening. Israel has launched deadly new strikes on Gaza, and Chevron is exploring oil and gas opportunities in Syria.
> - **Africa:** Beyond the Nigeria massacres, a government airstrike hit a [South Sudan hospital](https://www.aljazeera.com/), and Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, the late Libyan dictator's son, has reportedly been killed.

## Option A — Simulated Agent Team (4 roles)
**Token cost: ~135-260K | 4 agents (Researcher, Writer, Primary Editor, Senior Editor) | Multiple revision rounds**

> Good morning. Here is the state of play:
>
> A new chapter in nuclear uncertainty opened today. The last major arms control agreement between the United States and Russia has [officially expired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires), leaving the world's two largest nuclear arsenals without a formal framework limiting their size for the first time in decades. Neither Washington nor Moscow has signaled a clear path toward a replacement, and with relations between the two countries at their lowest point since the Cold War, the prospect of unchecked nuclear competition is now very real.
>
> That is not the only high-stakes confrontation this week. Chinese President Xi Jinping used a [call with Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html) to warn the US to be "prudent" on Taiwan arms sales, a pointed message that landed while Trump is busy arguing that his [unpredictable style](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html) gives him leverage in negotiations with allies and adversaries alike. Meanwhile, in western Nigeria, [gunmen killed more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) than 160 people in a series of attacks that the Red Cross is now responding to, one of the deadliest episodes of violence in the country in years.
>
> And diplomacy is not slowing down. The US and Iran are set to hold [talks in Oman](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/iran-us-talks-oman.html) on Friday, a rare direct channel that could shape the trajectory of the broader Middle East.
>
> **Business & Tech**
>
> - A **global tech selloff** is [deepening fast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/asian-stocks-to-fall-as-tech-led-drop-gains-pace-markets-wrap), dragging indices in Asia and Europe lower. Bitcoin has also dropped sharply, sliding toward $70,000 as risk appetite evaporates.
> - The **Washington Post** is [laying off 300+](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html) journalists, a staggering round of cuts at one of America's most storied newsrooms.
> - **SpaceX and xAI** are reportedly exploring a [deal to merge](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html), which would unite Elon Musk's rocket company with his AI venture under one corporate roof.
> - **Wind and solar projects** in the US are hitting a [Trump "blockade"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) that is stalling new permits and slowing the clean energy pipeline.
>
> **Around the World**
>
> - **Latin America**: Venezuela has detained several allies of Nicolas Maduro in what appears to be an internal purge, a sign of deepening fractures inside the ruling circle. ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/))
> - **Europe**: Italy is scrambling to finish construction for the [Cortina Olympics](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/europe/cortina-olympics-construction-italy.html), and the scene is chaotic. Separately, French authorities [raided X offices](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/europe/social-media-free-speech.html) in a widening dispute over social media regulation.
> - **Asia**: US aid cuts to Afghanistan are [threatening operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/asia/afghanistan-us-aid-cuts.html) in a country where millions depend on international assistance to survive.
> - **Middle East**: Israeli strikes on Gaza [killed more Palestinians](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strikes-palestinian-deaths.html) overnight, as the conflict continues with no ceasefire in sight.
> - **Africa**: A hospital in South Sudan was hit by an airstrike, compounding the humanitarian toll on a continent where [160+ were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) in western Nigeria by gunmen just days ago.

## Option B — 3-Call Chain (Write, Edit, Revise)
**Token cost: ~20-35K | 3 sequential passes | Explicit edit layer**

> Good morning. Here is the state of play:
>
> The last major nuclear arms control treaty between the US and Russia [expired overnight](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires), and there is nothing lined up to replace it. New START had capped each country's deployed strategic warheads at 1,550. Now those limits are gone, and neither Washington nor Moscow has shown interest in coming back to the table. This is the kind of story that slips past quietly, but the shift it represents is serious.
>
> Meanwhile, Xi Jinping [called Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html) and pressed him directly on Taiwan, warning against US interference. Beijing has also paused several deals with Panama over the canal dispute. And in Nigeria, gunmen [killed over 160](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) people in attacks across western communities. The Guardian led with the Nigeria story, and the BBC featured it prominently alongside the Xi-Taiwan call. The NYT, by contrast, led with Trump's [negotiating style](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html). Most of our international benchmarks chose non-US stories today.
>
> **Business & Tech**
>
> - A [global tech selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/asian-stocks-to-fall-as-tech-led-drop-gains-pace-markets-wrap) kept deepening as selling spread from Wall Street into Asian and European markets. Bitcoin is holding near $70,000, weathering the storm better than most tech names.
> - SpaceX and xAI are in talks for a possible [merger](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html), which would fold Musk's AI venture into his rocket company.
> - The Washington Post announced [300+ layoffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html), gutting its newsroom in one of the biggest cuts the paper has ever made.
> - Brad Karp [stepped down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html) as chairman of Paul Weiss after the law firm's ties to Jeffrey Epstein came under scrutiny.
> - The Trump administration is effectively [stalling clean energy](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) through a regulatory blockade on wind and solar projects, freezing billions in investment.
>
> **Around the World**
>
> *Latin America*
> - Venezuela has reportedly been [detaining Maduro allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/americas/venezuela-said-to-detain-maduro-allies-targeted-by-the-us.html) who were targeted by US sanctions. If confirmed, it would signal real fractures inside the regime.
>
> *Europe*
> - French authorities [raided X offices](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/europe/social-media-free-speech.html) in Paris over content moderation disputes, escalating the fight between EU regulators and Musk's platform.
>
> *Asia*
> - US [aid cuts](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/asia/afghanistan-us-aid-cuts.html) to Afghanistan are raising alarms among humanitarian groups, who warn the country's crisis will only deepen without support.
>
> *Middle East*
> - The US and Iran will sit down for [talks in Oman](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/iran-us-talks-oman.html) on Friday, a significant diplomatic opening. Separately, Israel continued [strikes on Gaza](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strikes-palestinian-deaths.html) with Palestinian deaths continuing to mount.
>
> *Africa*
> - The [Nigeria attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) that killed over 160 people dominated international headlines. Elsewhere on the continent, South Sudan saw a hospital hit by an airstrike and Mozambique is battling severe floods.

## Option C — Single Session Multi-Pass
**Token cost: ~15-25K | 1 session with self-review | Quick revision loop**

> Good morning. Here is the state of play:
>
> The last major US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty expired overnight, leaving the world's two largest nuclear arsenals without formal limits for the first time in decades. The [New START pact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires) had capped deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 per side since 2011, and neither Washington nor Moscow has signaled any urgency about a replacement. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping used a phone call with Trump to [press on Taiwan](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html), warning the US not to cross Beijing's red lines on the island. The call came as Trump defended his confrontational, unpredictable approach to [deals and diplomacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html), arguing the chaos gives him leverage even as allies struggle to keep up.
>
> In Nigeria, gunmen killed [over 160 people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) in an attack in the country's west, one of the deadliest episodes of violence there in years. The Guardian and BBC both led with the story, and the Red Cross confirmed casualties at multiple sites. Separately, a [hospital airstrike](https://www.aljazeera.com/) in South Sudan drew international condemnation, with Al Jazeera leading its coverage on the attack.
>
> Back in Washington, the chairman of elite law firm Paul Weiss [resigned over ties](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html) to Jeffrey Epstein, and the Washington Post announced it is [cutting 300+ jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html) in a major restructuring. Trump also moved to [block wind/solar](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) projects on federal land.
>
> **Business & Tech**
>
> - A global [tech selloff deepened](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/asian-stocks-to-fall-as-tech-led-drop-gains-pace-markets-wrap) for a second day, dragging Asian and European markets lower. Bitcoin tumbled toward $70K as risk appetite evaporated across the board.
> - Elon Musk's empire could get even bigger: SpaceX and xAI are exploring a [possible merger](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html) that would combine his rocket company with his AI startup.
> - The Washington Post is [laying off 300+](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html) employees as the paper continues to lose money under Jeff Bezos's ownership. It is the latest in a string of deep cuts across the news industry.
> - Spain announced a ban on social media for children under 16. Google reported strong earnings boosted by AI growth, and the ECB held [rates as expected](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/asian-stocks-to-fall-as-tech-led-drop-gains-pace-markets-wrap).
>
> **Around the World**
>
> - **Latin America:** Venezuela reportedly [detained Maduro allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/americas/venezuela-said-to-detain-maduro-allies-targeted-by-the-us.html) who were targeted by US sanctions, a surprising move that suggests internal fractures in the regime.
> - **Europe:** French authorities [raided X's offices](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/europe/social-media-free-speech.html) in Paris as part of a probe into the platform's content moderation practices. A Russian comedian was jailed for jokes critical of the war in Ukraine. And Cortina is gearing up for the Winter Olympics.
> - **Asia:** Afghanistan is bracing for the impact of [US aid cuts](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/asia/afghanistan-us-aid-cuts.html) that could devastate humanitarian operations across the country. Chinese journalists have been detained in a separate crackdown on press freedom.
> - **Middle East:** The US and Iran are set for [talks in Oman](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/iran-us-talks-oman.html) on Friday, the first direct engagement in months. Israel continued [strikes on Gaza](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strikes-palestinian-deaths.html), with Palestinian authorities reporting a rising death toll.
> - **Africa:** Gunmen killed [over 160 people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) in western Nigeria in one of the worst attacks in recent memory.

Good morning. Here is the state of play:

The last major nuclear arms control treaty between the US and Russia [expired overnight](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires), and there is nothing lined up to replace it. New START had capped each country's deployed strategic warheads at 1,550. Now those limits are gone, and neither Washington nor Moscow has shown interest in coming back to the table. This is the kind of story that slips past quietly, but the shift it represents is serious.

Meanwhile, Xi Jinping [called Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html) and pressed him directly on Taiwan, warning against US interference. Beijing has also paused several deals with Panama over the canal dispute. And in Nigeria, gunmen [killed over 160](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) people in attacks across western communities. The Guardian led with the Nigeria story, and the BBC featured it prominently alongside the Xi-Taiwan call. The NYT, by contrast, led with Trump's [negotiating style](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html). Most of our international benchmarks chose non-US stories today.

**Business & Tech**

- A [global tech selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/asian-stocks-to-fall-as-tech-led-drop-gains-pace-markets-wrap) kept deepening as selling spread from Wall Street into Asian and European markets. Bitcoin is holding near $70,000, weathering the storm better than most tech names.
- SpaceX and xAI are in talks for a possible [merger](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html), which would fold Musk's AI venture into his rocket company.
- The Washington Post announced [300+ layoffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html), gutting its newsroom in one of the biggest cuts the paper has ever made.
- Brad Karp [stepped down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html) as chairman of Paul Weiss after the law firm's ties to Jeffrey Epstein came under scrutiny.
- The Trump administration is effectively [stalling clean energy](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) through a regulatory blockade on wind and solar projects, freezing billions in investment.

**Around the World**

*Latin America*
- Venezuela has reportedly been [detaining Maduro allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/americas/venezuela-said-to-detain-maduro-allies-targeted-by-the-us.html) who were targeted by US sanctions. If confirmed, it would signal real fractures inside the regime.

*Europe*
- French authorities [raided X offices](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/europe/social-media-free-speech.html) in Paris over content moderation disputes, escalating the fight between EU regulators and Musk's platform.

*Asia*
- US [aid cuts](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/asia/afghanistan-us-aid-cuts.html) to Afghanistan are raising alarms among humanitarian groups, who warn the country's crisis will only deepen without support.

*Middle East*
- The US and Iran will sit down for [talks in Oman](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/iran-us-talks-oman.html) on Friday, a significant diplomatic opening. Separately, Israel continued [strikes on Gaza](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strikes-palestinian-deaths.html) with Palestinian deaths continuing to mount.

*Africa*
- The [Nigeria attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) that killed over 160 people dominated international headlines. Elsewhere on the continent, South Sudan saw a hospital hit by an airstrike and Mozambique is battling severe floods.

Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's transactional approach to diplomacy is getting a stress test from all directions. The president's [unpredictable style](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html) that he claims gives him leverage is running up against some hard realities. Xi Jinping pressed him directly on Taiwan during [their phone call](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html) yesterday, warning the US to be "prudent" about arms supplies to the island. That's diplomatic speak for backing off, and it shows how Beijing is testing Trump's resolve early.

The Epstein files continue to ripple through Washington and beyond, with [Brad Karp resigning](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html) as chairman of elite law firm Paul Weiss over the fallout. It's a reminder of how these revelations aren't just reshaping American politics but creating headaches for allies as well.

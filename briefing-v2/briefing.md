Good morning. Here's the state of play:

The biggest story breaking this weekend is escalating tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan after Pakistan launched [deadly strikes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgln3gnd6o) on Afghan territory, according to BBC reports. Afghanistan's Taliban government is promising an "appropriate response" to what they're calling unprovoked aggression. This comes after a suicide attack in Islamabad that Pakistan blamed on Afghan-based militants. This is a worrying escalation that could further destabilize the region just as the U.S. is already dealing with Iran tensions.

Speaking of Iran, there's another significant development there. Iranian students staged their [first large protests](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj2kzkrj0o) since the regime's brutal crackdown on demonstrations last year, per the BBC. The timing is notable given the high-stakes nuclear talks happening between Washington and Tehran right now. Iran's president says his country won't bow to U.S. pressure, while Trump is reportedly "curious" why Iran hasn't "capitulated" yet under American sanctions.

On the U.S. domestic front that has global implications: Trump is [doubling down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/trump-tariffs-trade-war.html) on tariffs despite the Supreme Court striking down his initial trade war measures. He's raising his global tariff to 15% and has an upcoming [summit with Xi](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/22/world/asia/trump-xi-jinping-meeting-china.html) where Taiwan and trade will loom large.

**Business/Tech**

• India has [postponed a trade trip](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-22/india-postpones-us-trip-to-finalize-trade-pact-on-tariff-ruling) to the U.S. after the Supreme Court's tariff ruling, Bloomberg reports. New Delhi was hoping to finalize a trade pact but now needs to recalibrate.

• Malaysia's anti-corruption chief is being [questioned](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3344265/malaysia-summons-anti-corruption-chief-stock-ownership-probe) in a probe about stock ownership, the South China Morning Post notes. This is an awkward moment for the country's graft-fighting efforts.

• JPMorgan finally [admitted it shut](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/jpmorgan-trump-debanking.html) Trump's accounts after January 6th. The bank had previously denied the debanking was political.

• Hong Kong's jewelry sales are [sparkling](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3344261/hong-kong-jewellery-sales-sparkle-amid-13pc-jump-mainland-chinese-visitors) again thanks to a 13% jump in mainland Chinese visitors, per SCMP.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America:** Over 1,500 Venezuelan political prisoners have [applied for amnesty](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w9g2dvn5o) under a new program, the BBC reports. This is a significant number that shows the scale of the country's political detention problem.

• **Europe:** Russia's shadow war in Europe is getting more sophisticated. The NYT profiles [an ex-taxi driver](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/22/world/europe/russia-sabotage-europe.html) who's become central to Moscow's sabotage operations across the continent.

• **Asia:** Divers have [recovered the bodies](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd8y96mldyo) of seven Chinese tourists from the bottom of Lake Baikal, the BBC reports. The group went missing during what was supposed to be a winter tourism excursion.

• **Middle East:** At least 10 people were [killed in Lebanon](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah.html) after Israeli strikes on Hezbollah positions, Lebanese officials say. The escalation threatens the fragile ceasefire that's been holding.

• **Africa:** Rwanda-backed rebels have [entered a key city](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rwanda-backed-rebels-enter-congo-safe-haven-city-aid-hub-09fdccb8) in Congo that serves as a major aid hub, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is a significant escalation in the region's long-running conflict.

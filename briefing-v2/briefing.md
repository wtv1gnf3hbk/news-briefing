Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump's trade war just got more expensive. After the Supreme Court struck down his initial 10% global tariff yesterday, the president doubled down and [raised rates](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html) to 15% with immediate effect. He's invoking Section 122, which gives presidents broad authority to impose border levies during national emergencies. The move puts him on a collision course with his own Supreme Court appointees, creating what one analyst called ["murky waters"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/tariffs-supreme-court-global-busines-reaction.html) for global businesses trying to navigate the legal uncertainty.

The ripple effects are already spreading. [European leaders](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/europe/political-uncertainty-trump-tariff-loss.html) who hoped to move past trade tensions are now facing fresh uncertainty, while businesses are warning consumers may be stuck in a [waiting game](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/tariff-ruling-consumer-prices.html) as companies decide whether to absorb costs or pass them along. The whole episode highlights a [growing divide](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html) among the Court's conservative justices that could complicate other parts of Trump's agenda.

**Business/Tech**

• [Sony's eyeing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-02-21/sony-says-diverse-capital-sources-key-for-acquisition-video) major acquisitions, according to Bloomberg, and is diversifying how it funds deals. Makes sense when you're swimming in PlayStation and movie cash.

• The AI boom isn't getting the love the dot-com era did. People are more skeptical about artificial intelligence than they were about the internet in the '90s, creating a [backlash problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html) for tech companies betting big on the technology.

• [Bitcoin's having](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/bitcoin-s-1-trillion-identity-crisis-hits-from-every-direction) an existential moment as it hits $1 trillion, per Bloomberg. Digital gold? Payment system? Something else? Even the crypto faithful can't seem to agree.

• India's trying to thread the needle on AI. At a major summit in New Delhi, officials are [seeking balance](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/asia/ai-summit-india-foreign-policy.html) between the U.S. and China as both superpowers compete for influence in the AI space.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Colombia's military is getting outmaneuvered by cheap technology. [Combat drones](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/americas/colombia-combat-drones-military.html) costing just $600 are proving more effective than billion-dollar weapons systems against armed groups, forcing a rethink of defense strategies.

• **Europe**: French politics is reeling after the killing of a nationalist student sent [shockwaves through](https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/a-week-in-france/20260221-killing-of-nationalist-student-has-repercussions-for-french-politics) the far left, according to France24. The incident could reshape dynamics ahead of upcoming elections.

• **Asia**: Russia and Ukraine are trading deadly blows. A [Russian attack](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/russian-attack-on-kharkiv-kills-two-ukraine-hits-missile-plant) on Kharkiv killed two people while Ukraine struck back at a missile manufacturing plant, Al Jazeera reports.

• **Middle East**: Iran is pushing back on international pressure. Tehran is [demanding evidence](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/iran-demands-evidence-as-trump-un-experts-highlight-protest-killings) to support U.S. and UN claims about protest killings, according to Al Jazeera, as Trump considers military options.

• **Africa**: The humanitarian crisis in Sudan is escalating. UN investigators found that the RSF siege of El Fasher has ["hallmarks of genocide,"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/19/rsf-siege-el-fasher-sudan-hallmarks-of-genocide-un-mission-north-darfur) the Guardian reports, as the paramilitary group tightens its grip on the strategic city.

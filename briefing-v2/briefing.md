Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump is [escalating his tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html) from 10% to 15% on all global imports, doubling down on his trade war strategy even as the Supreme Court debates whether he has the authority to impose these sweeping levies. The move creates immediate uncertainty for businesses worldwide and threatens to push consumer prices higher just as the global economy was finding its footing.

The timing is politically charged. Trump is betting that Americans will tolerate higher prices in exchange for what he calls economic nationalism, but the [conservative divide](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html) suggests even his own judicial appointees aren't convinced he has unlimited trade powers. Companies are caught in limbo, unsure whether to rush imports before rates climb higher or wait for potential court intervention.

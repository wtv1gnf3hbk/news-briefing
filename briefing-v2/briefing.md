Good morning. Here's the state of play:

Trump is escalating his trade war, announcing he'll [raise global tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html) from 10% to 15% on all imports. This comes even as the Supreme Court's conservative wing shows signs of fracturing over his sweeping use of tariff powers. The move creates fresh uncertainty for global businesses and consumers, who are already grappling with higher prices from the initial round of levies.

The timing is particularly striking given the brewing tensions with Iran. Trump is weighing [military options](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/us/politics/trump-iran-risks.html) against Tehran while Iranian students staged their first anti-government protests since the deadly crackdown, according to BBC. It's a reminder of how quickly economic pressure can intersect with geopolitical flashpoints.

**Business/Tech**

• NASA has pushed back its crewed moon mission again, this time because of [technical issues](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/nasa-rules-out-march-launch-for-manned-moon-mission-over-technical-issues) with the rocket, Al Jazeera reports. The March launch is now off the table entirely.

**Around the World**

• **Latin America**: Colombia's military is discovering that [cheap drones](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/americas/colombia-combat-drones-military.html) can outmaneuver billion-dollar defense systems. The $600 devices are giving insurgent groups a major tactical advantage in ongoing conflicts.

• **Europe**: Slovakia is threatening to [cut electricity](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-to-ukraine-over-russian-oil-spat) to Ukraine over a dispute about Russian oil transit, Al Jazeera reports. It's another sign of how energy politics continue to complicate European solidarity.

Good morning. Here's the state of play:

More than 160 people have been killed by gunmen in [attacks across Nigeria](https://www.theguardian.com/uk), one of the deadliest waves of violence the country has seen in years. That is leading headlines across London and other international outlets this morning, and the scale is staggering. At the same time, a pillar of global nuclear security has quietly collapsed: the last major arms control treaty between the US and Russia has [officially expired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires), leaving the world's two largest nuclear arsenals without any formal framework of limits or inspections for the first time in decades. That is genuinely dangerous, and it is happening at a moment when Washington and Moscow can barely speak to each other.

On the US-China front, Xi Jinping used a [phone call](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html) with Donald Trump to deliver a pointed message on Taiwan: be prudent about arms sales. Trump, meanwhile, is defending his unpredictable negotiating style in a new [NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html), arguing that keeping allies and adversaries guessing gives him leverage. But the costs are adding up. His administration is effectively [blocking hundreds](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) of wind and solar projects across the country, and the Epstein fallout keeps claiming powerful figures: Brad Karp, chairman of elite law firm Paul Weiss, has [stepped down](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html) over the firm's ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

**Business/Tech**

- The Washington Post is [cutting over 300](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html) journalists, one of the largest single rounds of newsroom layoffs in memory. A brutal blow to one of America's most storied papers.
- Google has gone from AI laggard to leader, posting [stellar growth](https://www.reuters.com/) numbers that suggest its AI investments are finally paying off.
- Global tech stocks are sliding further into a [broad selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/), Bitcoin is slumping toward $70,000, and silver is plunging. Not a fun morning for anyone holding risk assets.
- SpaceX and xAI, Elon Musk's AI venture, are [set to merge](https://www.bloomberg.com/), further consolidating his sprawling tech empire.

**Around the World**

- **Latin America:** Venezuela has [detained allies](https://www.reuters.com/) of Nicolas Maduro who had been targeted by US sanctions, a sign of deepening fractures inside the regime.
- **Europe:** France has [raided X's offices](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) as regulators turn up the heat on the platform, Cortina's Winter Olympics preparations are in chaos, and Spain has banned social media for kids under 16.
- **Asia:** Aid cuts to Afghanistan are [causing hunger](https://www.reuters.com/) and death on a devastating scale, and two Chinese journalists have been detained in a fresh crackdown on press freedom.
- **Middle East:** The US and Iran are set to hold [talks in Oman](https://www.aljazeera.com/) on Friday, a potentially significant diplomatic opening. Israel has launched deadly new strikes on Gaza, and Chevron is exploring oil and gas opportunities in Syria.
- **Africa:** Beyond the Nigeria massacres, a government airstrike hit a [South Sudan hospital](https://www.aljazeera.com/), and Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, the late Libyan dictator's son, has reportedly been killed.

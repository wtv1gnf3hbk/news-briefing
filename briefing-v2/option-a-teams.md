Good morning. Here is the state of play:

A new chapter in nuclear uncertainty opened today. The last major arms control agreement between the United States and Russia has [officially expired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-enter-uncertain-era-as-key-nuclear-pact-expires), leaving the world's two largest nuclear arsenals without a formal framework limiting their size for the first time in decades. Neither Washington nor Moscow has signaled a clear path toward a replacement, and with relations between the two countries at their lowest point since the Cold War, the prospect of unchecked nuclear competition is now very real.

That is not the only high-stakes confrontation this week. Chinese President Xi Jinping used a [call with Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/xi-phone-call-taiwan.html) to warn the US to be "prudent" on Taiwan arms sales, a pointed message that landed while Trump is busy arguing that his [unpredictable style](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/us/politics/trump-deals-allies-adversaries.html) gives him leverage in negotiations with allies and adversaries alike. Meanwhile, in western Nigeria, [gunmen killed more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) than 160 people in a series of attacks that the Red Cross is now responding to, one of the deadliest episodes of violence in the country in years.

And diplomacy is not slowing down. The US and Iran are set to hold [talks in Oman](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/iran-us-talks-oman.html) on Friday, a rare direct channel that could shape the trajectory of the broader Middle East.

**Business & Tech**

- A **global tech selloff** is [deepening fast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-04/asian-stocks-to-fall-as-tech-led-drop-gains-pace-markets-wrap), dragging indices in Asia and Europe lower. Bitcoin has also dropped sharply, sliding toward $70,000 as risk appetite evaporates.
- The **Washington Post** is [laying off 300+](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/media/washington-post-layoffs.html) journalists, a staggering round of cuts at one of America's most storied newsrooms.
- **SpaceX and xAI** are reportedly exploring a [deal to merge](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/technology/spacex-xai-deal.html), which would unite Elon Musk's rocket company with his AI venture under one corporate roof.
- **Wind and solar projects** in the US are hitting a [Trump "blockade"](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/climate/wind-solar-projects.html) that is stalling new permits and slowing the clean energy pipeline.

**Around the World**

- **Latin America**: Venezuela has detained several allies of Nicolas Maduro in what appears to be an internal purge, a sign of deepening fractures inside the ruling circle. ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/))
- **Europe**: Italy is scrambling to finish construction for the [Cortina Olympics](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/europe/cortina-olympics-construction-italy.html), and the scene is chaotic. Separately, French authorities [raided X offices](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/europe/social-media-free-speech.html) in a widening dispute over social media regulation.
- **Asia**: US aid cuts to Afghanistan are [threatening operations](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/asia/afghanistan-us-aid-cuts.html) in a country where millions depend on international assistance to survive.
- **Middle East**: Israeli strikes on Gaza [killed more Palestinians](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strikes-palestinian-deaths.html) overnight, as the conflict continues with no ceasefire in sight.
- **Africa**: A hospital in South Sudan was hit by an airstrike, compounding the humanitarian toll on a continent where [160+ were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/04/gunmen-west-nigeria-attack-red-cross) in western Nigeria by gunmen just days ago.

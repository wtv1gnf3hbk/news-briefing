<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump is escalating his trade war, announcing he'll <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">raise global tariffs</a> from 10% to 15% on all imports. This comes even as the Supreme Court's conservative wing shows signs of fracturing over his sweeping use of tariff powers. The move creates fresh uncertainty for global businesses and consumers, who are already grappling with higher prices from the initial round of levies.</p><p>The timing is particularly striking given the brewing tensions with Iran. Trump is weighing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/us/politics/trump-iran-risks.html" target="_blank">military options</a> against Tehran while Iranian students staged their first anti-government protests since the deadly crackdown, according to BBC. It's a reminder of how quickly economic pressure can intersect with geopolitical flashpoints.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• The AI boom isn't getting the same love as the dot-com era did. A new analysis shows <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html" target="_blank">public sentiment</a> around artificial intelligence is notably more skeptical than the enthusiasm that greeted the internet revolution.</p><p>• India is trying to thread the needle between Washington and Beijing at this week's AI summit, as New Delhi attempts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/asia/ai-summit-india-foreign-policy.html" target="_blank">chart its own course</a> in the tech competition between superpowers.</p><p>• NASA has pushed back its crewed moon mission again, this time because of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/nasa-rules-out-march-launch-for-manned-moon-mission-over-technical-issues" target="_blank">technical issues</a> with the rocket, Al Jazeera reports. The March launch is now off the table entirely.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Colombia's military is discovering that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/americas/colombia-combat-drones-military.html" target="_blank">cheap drones</a> can outmaneuver billion-dollar defense systems. The $600 devices are giving insurgent groups a major tactical advantage in ongoing conflicts.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Slovakia is threatening to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-to-ukraine-over-russian-oil-spat" target="_blank">cut electricity</a> to Ukraine over a dispute about Russian oil transit, Al Jazeera reports. It's another sign of how energy politics continue to complicate European solidarity.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: A tour bus carrying Chinese tourists <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3344231/bus-chinese-tourists-crashes-through-ice-russias-lake-baikal-killing-8" target="_blank">crashed through ice</a> on Russia's Lake Baikal, killing eight people, the South China Morning Post reports. Divers recovered the bodies from the bottom of the world's deepest lake.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: At least 10 people were killed in Lebanon after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah.html" target="_blank">Israel struck</a> Hezbollah targets, Lebanese officials say. The attack marks a significant escalation in cross-border tensions.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: The UN found that the assault on El Fasher in Sudan bears the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/19/rsf-siege-el-fasher-sudan-hallmarks-of-genocide-un-mission-north-darfur" target="_blank">"hallmarks of genocide,"</a> the Guardian reports, as the Rapid Support Forces continue their siege of the North Darfur capital.</p>

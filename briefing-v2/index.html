<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump's trade war just got more expensive. After the Supreme Court struck down his initial 10% global tariff yesterday, the president doubled down and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">raised rates</a> to 15% with immediate effect. He's invoking Section 122, which gives presidents broad authority to impose border levies during national emergencies. The move puts him on a collision course with his own Supreme Court appointees, creating what one analyst called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/economy/tariffs-supreme-court-global-busines-reaction.html" target="_blank">"murky waters"</a> for global businesses trying to navigate the legal uncertainty.</p><p>The ripple effects are already spreading. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/europe/political-uncertainty-trump-tariff-loss.html" target="_blank">European leaders</a> who hoped to move past trade tensions are now facing fresh uncertainty, while businesses are warning consumers may be stuck in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/business/economy/tariff-ruling-consumer-prices.html" target="_blank">waiting game</a> as companies decide whether to absorb costs or pass them along. The whole episode highlights a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html" target="_blank">growing divide</a> among the Court's conservative justices that could complicate other parts of Trump's agenda.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-02-21/sony-says-diverse-capital-sources-key-for-acquisition-video" target="_blank">Sony's eyeing</a> major acquisitions, according to Bloomberg, and is diversifying how it funds deals. Makes sense when you're swimming in PlayStation and movie cash.</p><p>• The AI boom isn't getting the love the dot-com era did. People are more skeptical about artificial intelligence than they were about the internet in the '90s, creating a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html" target="_blank">backlash problem</a> for tech companies betting big on the technology.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/bitcoin-s-1-trillion-identity-crisis-hits-from-every-direction" target="_blank">Bitcoin's having</a> an existential moment as it hits $1 trillion, per Bloomberg. Digital gold? Payment system? Something else? Even the crypto faithful can't seem to agree.</p><p>• India's trying to thread the needle on AI. At a major summit in New Delhi, officials are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/asia/ai-summit-india-foreign-policy.html" target="_blank">seeking balance</a> between the U.S. and China as both superpowers compete for influence in the AI space.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Colombia's military is getting outmaneuvered by cheap technology. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/world/americas/colombia-combat-drones-military.html" target="_blank">Combat drones</a> costing just $600 are proving more effective than billion-dollar weapons systems against armed groups, forcing a rethink of defense strategies.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: French politics is reeling after the killing of a nationalist student sent <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/a-week-in-france/20260221-killing-of-nationalist-student-has-repercussions-for-french-politics" target="_blank">shockwaves through</a> the far left, according to France24. The incident could reshape dynamics ahead of upcoming elections.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Russia and Ukraine are trading deadly blows.

Tehran is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/iran-demands-evidence-as-trump-un-experts-highlight-protest-killings" target="_blank">demanding evidence</a> to support U.S. and UN claims about protest killings, according to Al Jazeera, as Trump considers military options.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: The humanitarian crisis in Sudan is escalating. UN investigators found that the RSF siege of El Fasher has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/19/rsf-siege-el-fasher-sudan-hallmarks-of-genocide-un-mission-north-darfur" target="_blank">"hallmarks of genocide,"</a> the Guardian reports, as the paramilitary group tightens its grip on the strategic city.</p>

<p>Good morning. Here's the state of play:</p><p>Trump is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">escalating his tariffs</a> from 10% to 15% on all global imports, doubling down on his trade war strategy even as the Supreme Court debates whether he has the authority to impose these sweeping levies. The move creates immediate uncertainty for businesses worldwide and threatens to push consumer prices higher just as the global economy was finding its footing.</p><p>The timing is politically charged. Trump is betting that Americans will tolerate higher prices in exchange for what he calls economic nationalism, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-conservatives.html" target="_blank">conservative divide</a> suggests even his own judicial appointees aren't convinced he has unlimited trade powers. Companies are caught in limbo, unsure whether to rush imports before rates climb higher or wait for potential court intervention.</p><p><strong>Business/Tech</strong></p><p>• NASA has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/nasa-rules-out-march-launch-for-manned-moon-mission-over-technical-issues" target="_blank">delayed its moon mission</a> until at least April after discovering new technical problems with its Artemis rocket, according to Al Jazeera.</p><p>• India is scrambling to find alternatives as Trump's tariff hikes make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/business/india-russia-oil-trump-tariffs.html" target="_blank">buying Russian oil</a> significantly more expensive, forcing New Delhi to recalibrate its energy strategy.</p><p>• Honeywell is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-21/honeywell-considers-walking-away-from-johnson-matthey-catalyst-deal" target="_blank">considering walking away</a> from its planned acquisition of Johnson Matthey's catalyst business, Bloomberg reports, as regulatory hurdles mount.</p><p>• The AI boom is generating less public enthusiasm than the dot-com era did, as people grow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/21/technology/ai-boom-backlash.html" target="_blank">more skeptical</a> about artificial intelligence's promises.</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong></p><p>• <strong>Latin America</strong>: Cuba is facing what amounts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/20/world/americas/cuba-oil-blockade-trump.html" target="_blank">a new blockade</a> as Trump's sanctions choke off the island's oil supplies, creating the most severe energy crisis in decades.</p><p>• <strong>Europe</strong>: Slovakia is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/21/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-to-ukraine-over-russian-oil-spat" target="_blank">threatening to cut electricity</a> to Ukraine in an escalating dispute over Russian oil transit, Al Jazeera reports, opening a new front in European energy politics.</p><p>• <strong>Asia</strong>: Chinese tourists faced tragedy in Russia as a bus carrying them <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3344231/bus-chinese-tourists-crashes-through-ice-russias-lake-baikal-killing-8" target="_blank">crashed through ice</a> on Lake Baikal, killing eight people, the South China Morning Post reports.</p><p>• <strong>Middle East</strong>: Iranian students staged their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj2kzkrj0o" target="_blank">anti-government protests</a> since authorities killed hundreds in a brutal crackdown earlier this year, the BBC reports, suggesting the regime's repression hasn't fully silenced dissent.</p><p>• <strong>Africa</strong>: UN investigators found that the siege of El Fasher in Sudan bears <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/19/rsf-siege-el-fasher-sudan-hallmarks-of-genocide-un-mission-north-darfur" target="_blank">hallmarks of genocide</a>, the Guardian reports, as the Rapid Support Forces continue their assault on the Darfur city.</p>

A UAE firm's investment in Trump's crypto company creates new conflicts of interest while Democrats score an upset in deep-red Texas.

TOP STORY
The UAE investment in World Liberty Financial puts foreign money directly into Trump family business while the president shapes Middle East policy. This goes beyond typical ethics concerns about presidential business dealings - it creates a direct financial link between Trump family profits and a key Gulf ally's interests. The investment size and timing remain unclear, but it marks another erosion of traditional boundaries between presidential duties and personal wealth.

Good morning. A UAE firm quietly took a stake in the Trump family's crypto company World Liberty Financial, the New York Times reports.

TOP STORY
The investment creates potential conflicts of interest as Trump conducts foreign policy while his family benefits from Middle Eastern money. The UAE stake in World Liberty Financial wasn't publicly disclosed when it happened, putting Trump in the position of making decisions about a key Gulf ally while that same country has a financial relationship with his family business. The crypto venture has struggled to gain traction since launching, making foreign investment particularly significant for its prospects.
